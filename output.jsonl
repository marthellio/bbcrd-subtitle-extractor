And their votes will be combined with the judges' scores to decide who will be crowned Christmas champions 2021. CHEERING AND APPLAUSE And the winner will walk away with this - the Strictly Come Dancing Christmas Trophy! AUDIENCE: Ooh! Oh, my goodness! Speechless! So much better than a satsuma. Indeed. And kicking off our Christmas Special tonight is Fred Sirieix and Dianne. CHEERING AND APPLAUSE As the maitre d' on First Dates, Fred knows all about match-making, but, when it comes to dancing, has he found the perfect partner in Dianne? Let's find out. Bonjour. Are we rolling? My name is Fred Sirieix. I'm a maitre d' and I've been in the restaurant business all my life. I'm very lucky because I do so many different things from First Dates, to Step Up To The Plate and, of course, Gordon, Gino and Fred. The only dancing I do is at Christmas parties on top of tables with my shirt off. My partner is Dianne. I mean, didn't you guess? Look at my hair! We want to win and we actually believe that we can win. We want to get that glitterball. Please, please, Father Christmas, give us the glitterball! Please! Please! I was quite taken aback when Fred walked into the room. I didn't realise how much charisma Fred actually has. Everyone was going weak at the knees. # Je t'aime... # It was a lovely surprise. Merry Christmas! Fred! Dianne, how are you? I'm well. How are you? Je vais bien. Wow, your French is great. It's good, isn't it? How's your Australian? G'day! AUSTRALIAN ACCENT: How's it going? Thank you so much. Wow! Thank you very much. Thank you. Enjoy, guys. Thank you. So, Dianne, tell me, what are we going to wear? What about costumes? So I'm going to be in something really, really pretty, like gorgeous, Christmassy. And you are going to be dressed as... ..a turkey. NEEDLE SCRATCH Dianne... ..I have worked in the best restaurants in the world always dressed impeccably. If you think I'm going to go in front of the nation dressed as a turkey... ..you're right! Yes! Go, Fred! I knew you would come through. You're going to be the best Christmas turkey I've ever seen! # Welcome to my Christmas song... # We are dancing a quickstep. Six, seven. Down the table. At times, I have to say, it's a bit frustrating. There's a lot to remember. Round. Woo! I messed it up again, didn't I? Just a little. Until I get it right, I want to practise. Yes! The joy when he DOES get something right... Woohoo! That was brilliant! ..it's the best. Five, six, seven, eight. Yes! Yes! CHEERING AND APPLAUSE Dancing the quickstep, Fred Sirieix and Dianne Buswell. TURKEY GOBBLES MUSIC: Merry Christmas Everyone by Shakin' Stevens # Time for parties and celebration # People dancing all night long # Time for presents and exchanging kisses # Time for singing Christmas songs # We're gonna have a party tonight # I'm gonna find that girl underneath the mistletoe # We'll kiss by candlelight # Room is swaying # Records playing # All the old songs we love to hear # All I wish that every day was Christmas # What a nice way to spend the year # Shoo-be-doo-be, doo-be-doo-wap #Shoo-be-doo-be, doo-be-doo-wap # Shoo-be-doo-be, doo-be-doo-wap # Shoo-be-doo # Snow is falling Snow is falling # All around me All around me # Children playing Children playing # Having fun Having fun # It's the season # Love and understanding # Merry Christmas everyone. # CHEERING AND APPLAUSE Well done! Yay! Oh, my goodness! Wow! Joyeux Noel to you, as well. Thank you. C'est magnifique! CHANTS: Allez, red! Allez, red! Allez, red! Allez, red! Thank you, Fred. I bet that's woken everyone up from their Christmas slumber! Before we speak to the judges for the first time, let's hear it for our seasonal singers and, of course, Dave Arch and his brilliant orchestra. CHEERING AND APPLAUSE Merry Christmas, gang. You are a little gift, aren't you, Fred? Was that a surprise Christmas present, Shirley? Ooh, la, la! Tres bon, Frederique! What a way to open our Christmas show. A flying turkey with red hair like my glazed carrots. And shifting across the floor, not a single mistake in sight. Beautiful frame. Wonderful footwork. You were magnificent. Well done. Thank you, Shirley. CHEERING AND APPLAUSE Well done. Great start. Did that look like Christmas dinner at your house, Anton? Oh, that's exactly what... I absolutely agree with lady captain. You flew across the floor. Not a gap. The frame was quite nice. The footwork was incredible. It was tremendous. Great energy. Well done! Thank you, Anton. Lovely. Craig, happy Christmas. Happy Christmas, Tess. I did think you were trotting around like a turkey. AUDIENCE BOOS Maybe that was the whole point, darling. It was the point! But I have to agree with these guys, you did maintain your frame. Left shoulder was a little too high, but I know you haven't had a long time to train. Fantastic energy you brought to this number, you really did. Flew around the floor. Well done. C'est tres formidable! Formidable. Thank you. Motsi, it's the first time Fred's danced. He did well, didn't he? He did amazing. I was watching your eyes, actually, because I've never seen a person so happy to dance quickstep in their lives. All the joy for the dance, I was like, \"He's going \"to run out of here, we'll never see him again with Dianne!\" Keep her here! Well done. Very good quickstep. Good in the music, that I love very much, but you also understood the entertainment part of it and it was just a joy to watch. Thank you so much. What a joy. Thank you, Judges. For a debut, that was fantastic. Thank you. Thank you. Off you go to Claudia. Fred and Dianne, thank you so much. # We're gonna have a party tonight # I'm gonna find that girl... # What lovely comments. Never danced before. You dyed your hair red to match Dianne. We love commitment. Did you enjoy it? I loved it. I loved every second of it. You've been practising everywhere, am I wrong? Everywhere. In the garden, the garage, in the kitchen. I drove everybody mad! LAUGHTER And I was sending videos to Dianne. I think she thought I was mad, but I was thinking about her 24 hours a day. 24 hours a day. We all do! Once you've met Dianne, that just happens. Dianne, as a maitre d', I mean, precision, timing, everything has to be immaculate. He gave you all of that in training, didn't he? Yes, very precise. He's got the notebook. I think we did it like 13 times once and he wrote notes for himself 13 times! And you had such a laugh in training. Have you enjoyed the whole process? I loved every single second of it and I'm so glad it went well today. I owe it to Dianne because she's put so much effort in. I didn't want to let her down. You didn't. You did so good. I couldn't let her down because she's put so much into this. I've got to perform. I've got to deliver today. You absolutely smashed it. Good luck. The scores are in. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, the judges have their scores. Craig Revel Horwood. CHEERING Motsi Mabuse. Yay! Go on, Fredrick! Shirley Ballas. It's never too early for a Christmas 10 from Twirly Shirley! Yay! Anton Du Beke. I'm with Twirly Shirley! 38! 38? You have never danced before. Never. Only at the Christmas party on top of tables with my shirt off. That's the wrap party! Think of us. LAUGHTER Remember it's the audience vote combined with the judges' scores that decide who will be crowned Strictly Christmas champions '21. Still to come, Anne-Marie's routine features something cool and retro that plays music. Hello, Dave Arch! Tess. LAUGHTER Next on our Christmas list it is Moira Stuart and Aljaz. The legendary newsreader is now making headlines herself by joining our Strictly Christmas special. Over to you, Moira, to tell us more. CHEERING AND APPLAUSE Hi, I'm Moira Stuart and I've been attacking the British public for 40 years with radio and television news. The headlines this evening... I've been dancing all my life. My natural reaction to music, I can't keep still. It's like ants in your pants. My interpretation of the salsa is it's all in the hips. A bit of a shimmy and that's your lot. My partner is Aljaz. The man's a hunk. It would be lovely to win, if only to prove to my sisters that I'm not a total idiot. I'm here at Santa's Grotto and I am looking for the man himself and I'm hoping maybe, if I'm good, I might get the best gift ever. What would you like for Christmas, Moira? Would you like a scooter perhaps? Already got one. A nice handbag perhaps? What I'd really, really, really love is a Strictly professional dancer to do the salsa with. Let's see what we can do. He's a 19-time Slovenian Champion! Aljaz, you with me. OK. # Merry Christmas, merry Christmas # But I think I'll miss this one this year... # I'm finding the dance surprisingly simple... Santa's asleep. Three, four. Call the elf. ..and surprisingly difficult. One, two, three. Forward, forward, forward. The story of our dance is Moira is Mrs Santa and I'm an elf, and we're just basically trying to save the day with our salsa. Nice, one more. I'm all about rhythm, but I'm not so much about technicalities. You then forgot to do the turn. Come back. To actually shake my hips is glorious. Go back into salsa rhythm. Side and close. I would describe the salsa as hips for days, which is what I'm all about. Yes! That's it! Hips don't lie. Shakira, here I come. I got ya! CHEERING AND APPLAUSE Dancing the salsa, Moira Stuart and Aljaz Skorjanec. SANTA SNORES CLOCK CHIMES MUSIC: Santa Claus Is Coming To Town # Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah # Santa Claus is coming to town # You better watch out You better watch out # You better not cry You better not cry # You better not pout # I'm telling you why # Santa Claus is coming to town Santa's coming to town # He's making a list Making a list # He's checking it twice Checking it twice # He's gonna find out # Who's naughty or nice # Santa Claus is coming to town Santa's coming to town # He sees you when you're sleeping # He knows when you're awake # He knows when you've been bad or good # So be good for goodness' sake # You better watch out, You better not cry # You better not pout, Telling you why # Santa Claus is coming to town Santa's coming to town... # So it's that time of the year when you let all your problems go. And, you know, you just... # Shake it, shake it, baby! # Shake it, shake it, baby! # Ooh, do do do do do do Santa's coming to town # Oooh Santa Claus is coming to town # Ooh, ooh, ooh Santa Claus is coming to town # Santa Claus is coming to town Santa's coming to town. # CHEERING AND APPLAUSE Ho, ho, ho! You did it! You did it! CROWD: Moira! Moira! Moira! Moira, come on, my darling. Come, partner. Elf has lost his hat. Oh, that was brilliant. And we're spoiling you, look, an Elf and Santa Claus! I'm a greedy girl. And thank you, Cameron, Santa Claus. I think that's brightened up all of our Christmas no end. Enjoy it? Loved it, absolutely. Well, let's hope it's good news from this lot. Anton? I can't believe this. For 15 years, I've been asking you to do this show with me. I turn me back for a second and you're on with a young, firm model! Yep! I'm furious! But, I tell you, you were terrific. You were grooving and you were moving... APPLAUSE I loved it, well done. Are you going to be naughty or nice, Craig? I'm going to be nice. I really, really enjoyed that. APPLAUSE You came down the stairs like Shirley Bassey, you had all that confidence and you got into a fabulous groove. It was great. And hip action, darling! Thank you. Amazing. Loved it. APPLAUSE Motsi? A Christmas wonder - we agree! Yeah. LAUGHTER I absolutely loved that. I love just how you're walking down the stairs, coming down the stairs, doing the salsa, \"Look at me! \"Look at me! \"Go away, Aljaz. Come, Santa Claus, come here\". LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE Brilliant! We loved that little groove, didn't we? Finally, Shirley? Well, a super cool Mama Claus, who, like she said, got to dance with two men in the Christmas special! Just lovely, loads of swag, you were shaking and baking. You looked like you had the time of your life. You e... This tricky little bit of footwork here, you were absolutely spot on. What a lovely ear for music you have. Congratulations, well done. APPLAUSE Aw, thank you! Thank you. Thank you. Congratulations. That was an absolute gift. Thank you very much, Moira and Aljaz. Thank you, judges! APPLAUSE ALJAZ SHOUTS We did it! # You better watch out, you better not cry # You better not pout, I'm telling you why # Santa Claus is coming... # You were brilliant. Moira, you asked for the salsa, were you happy with it? I adored it. This man is incredible, he has taught me so many things. And I will never, never, never forget it, or be anything other than grateful. Oh! Oh! You've been wonderful. You had such a good time together and you also love live music. What did you think of Dave Arch and his... Oh! ..orchestra? That orchestra, wow! I just want to stand in the middle and just absorb it. Oh, it's so gorgeous and the singers! I know! They're amazing. And the drummer! Ah, ah! Amazing. OK. So happy. Aljaz, you have been delighted with Moira. Ah... Her attitude, the hips, the fact that she wanted a salsa. I've been in this country for over ten years and I know you're this incredible broadcasting legend. Yes. And for me to have... Correct. ..this opportunity to dance with you on Strictly Come Dancing, it's a little dream come true for me, as well, so, thank you so much. Thank you. Beautifully said, Aljaz. You're absolutely lovely, thank you. You are a legend, and we're just going to stop this chat because we have a BBC News report. Moira, dear Moira. Once upon a time, you were elegantly gracing the news studio and now look at you! Elegantly gracing the Strictly dance floor with a salsa to die for. I think I've gone to heaven, Moira, I really do. But, moving on, and back to our senior dancing correspondent, Claudia. Nice! Thank you, Huw! Thank you. Good luck, you were both spectacular. Thank you. Thank you. The scores are in. The judges' scores are in. Craig Revel Horwood. APPLAUSE Thank you, thank you, thank you! Motsi Mabuse. BOTH: Thank you. Shirley Ballas. My goodness! Anton Du Beke. Moira, you beauty... Yes! Lovely! Yes! APPLAUSE A score of 33. Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas! CLAUDIA: Yes, lovely, Anton. Still to come, Jay and Luba dance an Only Fools And Horses jive. Tess. But next in our Strictly stocking, it's singer Anne-Marie and Graziano. Anne-Marie has collaborated with some incredible artists during her career, including Little Mix, Sean Paul, Ed Sheeran. But, for one night only, it's Anne-Marie featuring Graziano. APPLAUSE So, I'd say Anne-Marie? Yeah. Anne-Marie, take two... ..hundred! # Ciao adios, I'm done... # I'm a singer-songwriter, artist, karate champion. SHE GIGGLES I do feel like people expect pop stars just to be able to dance. People have an expectation and I just want to squash that very quickly. I'm partnered up with Graziano. He has a lot of hip movement. SHE GIGGLES So, it's Christmas. We are doing the cha-cha-cha. I sound so posh when I say that, I've never sounded posh in my life. Ch... Cha... Cha! The cha-cha-cha is very... I don't know... ..rubber bandy and I'm quite stiff. My friends, they keep telling me, \"Remember, just enjoy it\", basically, because I'm so competitive that the only option for me is to win. I'm here, Riverside Studios, at Top Of The Pops. My partner, Anne-Marie, invited me to meet with her, behind the scenes. Hello! Nice jumper! Christmas came early! You want to go and see me do sound check? Yes! # Go ahead boy, you can kiss my... # You can kiss my... # You are amazing! Thank you for coming. It was like a concert just for me and I was dancing all the way through. But, next time, she's gonna jump into my world. Get ready. # Kiss my... # Two-ca-raka-roka-change! I have about eight blisters on my feet, but I do feel my bum's getting more toned, so I'm really happy about that! Hips, hips, hips. There is a lot of feminine movements and it's quite difficult for me, because I'm not... ..that feminine. I have never been sexy in my whole life! SHE SQUEALS I love Graziano. I think because I haven't been this close to another man... ..in so long... I'm not too keen on the spinning of the lift, that makes me feel sick in 0.3 seconds. So, when I land, who knows how the dance is going to end. APPLAUSE Dancing the cha-cha-cha, Anne-Marie and Graziano Di Prima. MUSIC: Feliz Navidad by Jose Feliciano CHEERING # Feliz Navidad # Feliz Navidad # Feliz Navidad # Prospero ano y felicidad # I wanna wish you a merry Christmas # I wanna wish you a merry Christmas # I wanna wish you a merry Christmas # From the bottom of my heart # Zoom-zoom-zoom-zoom # Zoom-zoom-zoom-zoom # Zoom-zoom-zoom-zoom # Zoom-zoom-zoom-zoom # I wanna wish you a merry Christmas # I wanna wish you a merry Christmas # I wanna wish you a merry Christmas # From the bottom of my heart # I wanna wish you a merry Christmas... # APPLAUSE # I wanna wish you a merry Christmas # I wanna wish you a merry Christmas # From the bottom of my heart. # APPLAUSE CHEERING What?! Oh, wow! Anne-Marie featuring Graziano, I think you've got a hit on your hands. Those lifts were superb. You looked gorgeous doing the cha-cha. Thank you. We know Anne-Marie can sing, but can she dance, Craig? Fab-u-lous, darling! Yes! CHEERING I'm so glad he said that! Motsi? Yeah, well, that was a cha-cha-cha, hot chilli cha-cha-cha. Well done. Beautiful legs, beautiful timing. The music on that! Absolutely entertaining, you rock, you rock, girl! APPLAUSE You rock! Shirley. You are the glittery star at the very top of the tree. You had all sorts of sparkles going on, from lifts... When you started your first walks there, with those straight legs, you looked like you have danced for a long time and I know that you haven't. It's absolutely superb. You had all sorts going on - good frame, natural touch, you chucked the whole lot in, and that lift. And the exit - beautiful. Well done. Thank you. Wasn't it? So well done. Anton, did you enjoy that? Ha-ha-ha! Ooh! What an absolute Christmas cracker! Absolutely beauty. The first part, wasn't it amazing? Fantastic. Yum, bum, bum, ratata. Yum, bum, ratata. Little one and a little one and oh! You've got him going now, Anne Marie. You've got him going. Throw me over, turn me round! Woo! OK. We're still going to be here at Boxing Day at this rate. I loved that. I don't know what any of that just meant. LAUGHTER I think he liked it. Gorgeous. Well done. Thank you very much. Could she be our Christmas number one? Let's hear it for Anne-Marie and Graziano. Gorgeous. Thank you, darling. Yes! # I wanna wish you a merry Christmas # I wanna wish you a merry Christmas... # I mean, Anne-Marie, a cha-cha to your favourite song, with Graz. Those comments from the judges. How has Strictly been for you? Unbelievable. From the start to the finish, I can't actually believe... ..that compared to how I started it, and it's all thanks to him. He brought out the feminine side to me. I'm a tomboy. Yes. And that was hard. Also, do you know what I love about you? You are a rock god. You go out there, hundreds and thousands of people, and then, just when Craig said fabulous, you sort of fell apart. Was it lovely, getting those comments? I... When I perform, I don't really do dance routines. Yes. I just run about, do a kick every now and again, and so doing something completely different, an actual dance routine and getting comments like that, I was just so happy. You didn't hold back, Graziano. This is Christmas. You could have said, \"You don't dance. Don't worry. \"We'll just do some swaying.\" But you didn't do that. First time we met, I was really nervous and I taught her the cha-cha. She was magnifique. Yes. It's been amazing. Utterly brilliant. We have a message for you from one of your many collaborators. Have a look. Aye, yo, Anne-Marie. It's your boy - KSI. How you doing? I just wanted to give you a great congratulation on your cha-cha-cha on the Strictly Come dance floor. Also, I want to wish everyone a very merry Christmas and a happy New Year. Take care and peace, guys. So lovely. Aw, I love him. I know, he's adorable. Enormous luck. Thank you. The dance was amazing. The scores are in. Oh, my gosh. The judges have their scores. Craig Revel Horwood. SHE SCREAMS Motsi Mabuse. Shirley Ballass. Anton Du Beke. SHE SCREAMS Oh, my God! It's the first time for me, don't worry. Singlehandedly the best reaction... Any people who lift the glitterball trophy, they've danced for months, no. It's all about that. How happy are you? I'm so happy. My cheeks actually hurt. And how happy is your mum going to be? Because I know she's a massive fan. I think, at the end, I looked at her and she just was like that. Yeah. So, hopefully, she's good. She's good. Well done. Remember, tonight, it's the studio audience vote combined with the judges' scores that decide who will become our Christmas champions. Three couples have danced. We still have all of this to come. The dance is a jive and I've never done it. I do the dad dance. The jive is backs and forwards and... I'm telling you, it's proper full-on. I'm finding a measure of fluency I never thought I'd have, but then, as soon as I get it, I get excited and then I end up messing something up again. I can do all the steps, I just can't necessarily do them in the right order. Five, six, here we go. Neil, Neil Jones, very blooming cool with his street commercial. Tap, up, down, move and up. I'm so not street. How do I get street? I'm going to hang out with some young'uns and then I will emerge fully street commercial. Our next couple's jive pays tribute to a legendary sitcom that we all enjoy watching at this time of year. Jay Blades and Luba have transformed themselves into Del Boy and Rodney for our Only Fools And Horses Christmas Special. I'm Jay Blades and people know me from The Repair Shop. Now, this is a big part of Christmas. Are you ready to be reunited? Ah! I've been doing The Repair Shop for about five years. It is really nice, making other people smile, people you don't know. I have always been a fan of Only Fools And Horses. I used to work on the market stalls, a bit like Del Boy, and I was a bit of a likely lad. So, to dance to the theme tune, it's quality. This time next week, we could be Strictly champions. Training is painful. My body doesn't move this way. As they say, no pain, no gain. Only Fools And Horses - do I know anything about it? No. So what...what does this guy...Rodney? He calls him, \"You plonker.\" Yeah. Luba has been amazing, teaching me how to do this dance, and I've got a little surprise for her outside. Here you go. Oh, wow! This is the car? This is the car. Come on, in you get. Oh. Ooh! Come on, stay with me. Stay with me. This is such an iconic car. I never thought I would ever be driving this. I wonder what that button does. BOTH: Whoa! Hey! What's going on here?! How did you do that? Magic. The magical button. Have you just come from Peckham? Down the market. We want some advice to be a better Del Boy and a better Rodney. He does a lot of this. He says, \"Cozmic.\" Cozmic. Cozmic. And then, Del Boy, what can I do? You know Del Boy. You are Del Boy. You... He's all wheeling dealing, he's always moving, he's always on the front foot. So favourite scenes? The chandelier drop. That's my favourite. \"Look, they're winning. They're winning. \"What could possibly go wrong?\" Well, you'll be pleased to know that we have got the chandelier in the beginning, innit? You have to. Good luck, guys. Obviously we want you to win. We don't care about anyone else. Right, remember, he who dares wins. And she. Cushty! Lovely, jubbly. Lovely, jubbly! Good luck, guys. Meeting those guys and just getting those little tips what I needed... Love it. ..I feel totally inspired. I'm ready to rock and roll now. Lovely, jubbly. Right, we've got a show to do, boys. Dancing the jive, Jay Blades and Luba Mushtuk. # We've got some half price, cracked ice # And miles and miles of carpet tiles # TVs, deep freeze And David Bowie LPs # Board games, gold chains # What's-names pictures frames and leather goods # And Trevor Francis track suits # From a mush in Shepherd's Bush # Bush, Bush, Bush, Bush, Bush, Bush # No income tax, no VAT # No money back, no guarantee # Black or white, rich or poor # We'll cut prices at a stroke # God bless Hooky Street # Viva Hooky Street # Long live Hooky Street # C'est magnifique # Hooky Street # Magnifique # Hooky Street # Hooky Street # Hooky Street # Hooky Street # Hooky Street... # Rodney, come on! # Stick a pony in me pocket # I'll fetch the suitcase from the van # Cos if you want the best # And you don't ask questions # Then, brother, I'm your man # Cos where it all comes from is a mystery # It's like the changing of the seasons # And the tides of the sea # But here's the one that's driving me berserk # Why do only fools and horses work? # La, la, la, la # La, la, la, la, la # La, la, la, la # La, la, la, la, la # La, la, la, la # La, la, la, la, la # Why do only fools and horses work? # LAUGHTER Oh, my God! All right, thank you very much. Jay and Luba with the jive. Yeah. I think you enjoyed dancing that as much as we enjoyed watching it, didn't you? I love the show and I love the jive. It was just beautiful. Absolutely perfect. It was perfect. What do you think of our Del Boy, Motsi? Well, usually when people dance jive, they look really anxious and they're quite stressed, but not Jay. Jay was like, \"Jive, you watch me do this.\" That was fun. You were cool. You were collected. There was a swagger about doing it and totally easy and smooth. Well done. Thank you. Thank you. So smooth, wasn't he, Shirley? That was a real treat from a cheeky chappie, but can I just say to everybody at home, do not try that leapfrog after a few sherries?! It's actually a difficult move. I applaud you for trying that. Lovely timing. You kept it all together and you look like you had an absolute Christmas ball. I did. Well done. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Del Boy's selling. Are you buying, Anton? Oh-ho! One Christmas cracking spectacular to another. Absolute beauty. I thought your jive was terrific. I really enjoyed it. Kicks and flicks, what more do you want? Thank you. Thank you. APPLAUSE AND CHEERING What more DO you want? Craig? Luba, I'm absolutely loving Rodney's transformation, darling! Into a pair of heels, little cut-off shorts! I really liked it. I think you've got a fantastic energy out there, it was very compact, some nice kicks. A little bit flat-footed all the way through, but I think... BOOING There's got to be one boo on Christmas Day, darling, why not? You know, have another drink. But I loved it, I think you did really, really well. Congratulations. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. We all loved it, didn't we? Your work here is done. Thank you so much, Jay and Luba, off you go. APPLAUSE AND CHEERING Thank you. You are the world's biggest Only Fools And Horses fan. How was that for you? It was a dream come true. To actually dance it, to see the music and everything just all roll into it. Yeah. I feel good. You SHOULD feel good. Thank you. You worked so hard. You have found out that you have muscles in your toes. Yeah. Expand, please. I never knew there was muscles in me toes cos basically the jive is all about being on your toes, so, after the first session, I woke up to the sensation, must have been about three o'clock in the morning, just \"vwoop, vwoop, vwoop\" on my toes. I never knew my toes could breathe like that, it was crazy, but it's good. We think we've got a message that you're really going to love. A message? Have a look at this. OK. Hello, Jay! It's your old mate Del Boy here. APPLAUSE AND CHEERING I understand you're doing a bit of prancing about up there, at the BBC. Well, good luck with that, my son. Oh, by the way, I understand that you're doing it to my theme song, right? That means there will be a royalty. Put it in an envelope at the BBC reception centre, I'll pick it up later. In the meantime, I want to wish you all the best, and all the people that are watching the show and all the people out there that help make the show, I wish you all a very happy Christmas and a jolly good new year. All right? You know it makes sense. Good luck. APPLAUSE AND CHEERING Thank you so much, Sir David. I know he's a hero of yours. That meant a lot, didn't it? It meant a lot, that's... Yeah, that's just too much. That's a Christmas present. That's special, that's real special. Well, he wanted to do it for you. Good luck. Thank you. The scores are in. Will the judges please reveal their scores? Oh, man. Craig Revel Horwood. Motsi Mabuse. Shirley Ballas. Anton Du Beke. Well, it's not a mange-tout, don't be a plonker! Well done! Thank you. 34, happy with that? Yep, totally happy. I'm chuffed with David Jason, come on. Del Boy. I know, absolutely unbelievable. Still to come, Mel is krumping, breaking, locking and indeed popping. Please can someone call the physio? Tess. APPLAUSE I'm on it. Our fifth festive couple is Adrian Chiles and Jowita. In 30 years of broadcasting, Adrian has done it all, from Radio 5 Live to the One Show, to Match Of The Day 2. But he's never danced an American smooth in the snow to White Christmas, until now. APPLAUSE AND CHEERING My name is Adrian Chiles, I'm a writer and broadcaster. Good morning to you, it's... Whoops, excuse me, just knocked my coffee over. It's 11 o'clock on... It's 11 o'clock on 5 Live. I love being a journalist because it allows me to satisfy my curiosity. I can ask people questions and do strange things, like this. I'm dancing an American smooth Viennese waltz, whatever that means. My dance partner is Jowita. It's her first season on the show. She is brilliant. When I told my family, told my friends that I was coming on Strictly, they went, \"You're mad.\" And, on reflection, I think they were right. Here's the weather. We've had a cold snap across most of the country, with plenty of snow flurries, which has got us all dreaming of a white Christmas. VOICE ECHOES AND FADES SNORING Dancing the American smooth, ballroom world champion Adrian Chiles and Jowita Przystal. ANTON: I LOVED you in hold. SHIRLEY: Captivating! A moment in time. Just beautiful. CRAIG: What an achievement. MOTSI: I knew you had it in you. PHONE RINGS Oh, what a weird dream. Hi, Adrian! We need to rehearse! OK, coming. When we're actually trying to do the whole routine, I'm thinking, \"Was that right?\" Where am I looking? \"Is this right, what I'm doing now?\" Side, change. So then you forgot what you're doing. Trying to get the timing. I've forgotten what's next. I'm so delighted my feet are doing the right thing that I lose interest in my hands. The bit I'm finding the hardest is pulling an appropriate expression. I'm not quite sure what you're supposed to do with your head. Head. Yes! And... It's just the look of terror in my eyes. I'm like this. Doing something called a fleckerl, I've never heard of. I think Adrian thinks he cannot dance, but, to be honest, he can. Christmas will only begin for me when we get to the final bar of our dance. No smiles, nothing till then! APPLAUSE AND CHEERING Dancing the American smooth, Adrian Chiles and Jowita Przystal. # I'm, I'm dreaming # Dreaming of a white # White Christmas, y'all # Just like the one # That I used to know-oh # Honey, it's where the tree tops # Where the tree tops glisten # Little bitty, little bitty, little bitty children # They try to listen # To hear # Before the sleigh bells that are ringing in the snow-oh # I wanna tell you one more time what I'm thinking about # And may all # And may all of your Christmases # Baby, may your days, may your days # Be merry, be merry, merry and bright # Lord have mercy # I wish all of 'em, honey # And may all your Christmases # Be so white # I must say of a white # Dreaming of a white Christmas # Dreaming, dreaming of a Christmas. # APPLAUSE AND CHEERING Yes! Aww! That was absolutely gorgeous. Can you hear them over there? CHANTING AND STAMPING I know you were probably the most nervous of all our Christmas cast. Are you relieved now? It doesn't come close to what I feel, but, yes, I'm relieved. OK. You were in safe hands with Jowita. I was, yeah. Shirley, were you transported to a winter wonderland? I WAS transported and you really warmed my heart. It was extremely... APPLAUSE AND CHEERING ..just floating. You were debonair, you were sophisticated. You packed so much into that routine, you had lifts, you had some basic in there, you even did a lovely fleckerl. You absolutely, together, looked beautiful. It was so warming, thank you, thank you for sharing that with us. Thank you. Was it everything that YOU were dreaming of for Christmas, Anton? Oh! If only you knew what I wanted for Christmas. LAUGHTER What I wanted was that performance. It was glorious, wonderful and sophisticated. You looked after her, you danced beautifully, I loved it. And in a tail suit! Hurray! Merry Christmas. APPLAUSE AND CHEERING You made the king of ballroom happy at Christmas - no mean feat. Are you happy, Craig? Well, that snowman had more personality, darling. GROANING, BOOING Crikey. I'm not going to talk too much about the dance because I know your family is sat right here, and I don't want to ruin their Christmas. I've got to say, it was sweet, it was innocent, it was dapper, you looked... Respect, darling, you looked great out there. So glad that ended well. Motsi. Well, I felt, I was looking at that and I was like, \"How I would have loved to dance at Christmas just like that.\" You were taking care of her, you were so gentle. When you lifted her... ..I mean, it all looked so... ..I don't know, like a dream world. APPLAUSE AND CHEERING Aww! Gorgeous! Off you go and get the scores, Adrian and Jowita. Well done. As Tess said, you were our most nervous, you were like, \"Don't make me do it. I WILL do it, just for Jowita! Did you enjoy it? I wouldn't say enjoy was quite the right word, but, no, I did in places, when I felt as if I knew what I was doing. But I was getting such sweet encouragement from Jowita, going, \"It's good.\" He's been a fantastic student, hasn't he? Oh, my gosh. He's the best and he's my first Strictly partner. I know! And I'm so happy that it's actually him, and thank you so much for that because you made my dream come true. I performed on the Strictly floor with a celebrity partner. Thank you, you're the best. Her dream was to perform with 16st worth of West Brom supporter, that's all she wanted! Your daughters have banned you from doing Strictly, but one of your daughters, your mum and your partner are all in the audience. Yes. What do you think they will have thought about? I don't know, I'll find out shortly. They don't look too horrified, they seem to be smiling, so I might have got away with it. Good luck. You were excellent. Thank you. The scores are in. The scores are in. Craig Revel Horwood. Motsi Mabuse. Shirley Ballas. Anton Du Beke. Sophisticated! This is lovely! Happy with that? Yes, I'll settle for that all day long. Well done. Still to come, all of our couples take to the floor for a mammoth group number. How is it going, Adrian? Give us a taste. I'd keep your eye on me if you want some laughter to take into Boxing Day, I think. Yeah, it's looking good. OK. We cannot wait. Back to you, Tess. Before that, it's Mel Giedroyc and Neil. Mel loves nothing more than watching this show at home, but, for one night only, our Strictly superfan is going to be right in the middle of the action, performing a street dance, and she couldn't be happier. APPLAUSE AND CHEERING My name is Mel Giedroyc. I've been working for about 30 years in the business of show. On your marks. Get set. BOTH: Bake. Finally, at age 53, I'm ready to break out some dance manoeuvres in front of some people. I'm with the one, the only Neil Jones. Just wonderful, really going into Christmas with the right spirit. I'm dancing street commercial... WHISPERS: Street commercial. ..to the one, the only Vanilla Ice, Ice Ice Baby. I think the bar will be very, very low in most people's minds and that's absolutely fine by me. One and two. There's quite a difference between dancing on your own in the kitchen to actually coming into a studio. What I lack in skill I will make up for in enthusiasm. Mel has taken on the street side. It's completely taken over. She's like, \"What's up, Neil?\" Going home, I'm like, \"Yo, what's for supper? # Da, da, da, da, da, da # What's in the fridge, are we having broccoli? # I've gone Vogue, that's wrong. Not Vogue, it's street. Bring it on, Christmas Day, street. Mm! # Wishing you a very Merry Christmas... # How Christmassy does it look here? So, now, the reason I brought you here is, of course, the whole concept of the dance is that we are on ice. It's very festive. Yes! Do you like to ice skate? Do you know? I remember, Neil, I haven't actually skated that much, probably since I was about 13, so about 25 years ago. Why don't you go on? I'll watch you and give you a few tips. Right, excuse me. Please could you clear the ice, ice, baby? MUSIC: Bolero by Ravel CHEERING Yeah, I know what you're going to say. The backspin needs work, I know. The double loop's a little bit rusty, but I did my best. I'm ready to dance, let's go. APPLAUSE AND CHEERING Dancing Street commercial, Mel Giedroyc and Neil Jones. Yo, VIP, let's kick it! # Ice ice baby # All right, stop Collaborate and listen # Ice is back With my brand-new invention # Something Grabs a hold of me tightly # Flow like a harpoon Daily and nightly # Will it ever stop? Yo, I don't know # Turn off the lights and I'll glow # To the extreme I rock a mic like a vandal # Light up a stage And wax a chump like a candle # Now that the party is jumping # With the bass kicked in The Vegas are pumpin' # Quick to the point To the point no faking # Cooking MCs like a pound of bacon Police on the scene # You know what I mean? They passed me up # Confronted all the joke fiends If there was a problem # Yo, I'll solve it Check out the hook # While Giedroyc revolves it Ice ice baby # Vanilla ice ice baby # Vanilla ice ice baby # Vanilla ice ice baby # Yo, man, let's get out of here! # Word to your mother! # Hey-hey, hey-hey # Sleigh bells ring, are you listening? # In the lane, snow is glistening # A beautiful sight, we're happy tonight # Walking in a winter wonderland # Ice ice baby too cold # Ice ice baby too cold, too cold. # APPLAUSE AND CHEERING LAUGHTER Brilliant! That was brilliant! How much fun was that? I've done myself a mischief! I was about to say you were living your best life out there, but... It was amazing. Props, penguins, there was a lot going on. How did she do, Anton? Oh, it was brilliant! APPLAUSE AND CHEERING Thank you! Yes! Brilliant. I loved every second of it. I loved the way you performed it, I loved the chairography, the penguinography, it was brilliant! Well done. Thanks, Anton! Amazing. Happy Christmas. I know you like a bit of street dance after a few eggnogs, Craig. I do indeed! How was Mel's? Well, I have seen hip action before, I've never seen tongue action choreographed, darling. Best at that. At the end there, with your little mic job. Full of rhythm, it was into the ground, it was completely together. Precise. I thought you did a fantastic job. APPLAUSE AND CHEERING Thank you, Craig! Yes! Thank you! Motsi? Oh, man, I wish every day was Christmas. He's so nice today! Isn't he lovely? Guys, that was fun, that was pure fun. That was the best way to end this absolutely beautiful evening. I want to go out with you after the show cos that's the right vibe. # Vanilla ice ice baby # Uh-uh-uh uh-uh # Vanilla ice ice baby. # She's still dancing, Shirley! Oh, my goodness, you absolutely sum up the joy of Christmas. I have a feeling that everybody, after watching that routine, will gather round the fire and they'll all be getting up and doing the moves. SHIRLEY CHUCKLES You will have inspired so many families. Yeah. It was joyous. What a way to close our show. Well done. APPLAUSE AND CHEERING Thanks, guys. Congratulations. You know what comes next, Mel. We go up the little stairsies to Claudia. Yes, you do. Shall we go as Vanilla Ice again? Do it, do it. Keep the moves going. Thank you, Mel and Neil. You love this show so much. How was it to take part and then get those comments from the judges? This is literally all my Christmases, all 53 of them, come at once. There you go. I mean, it couldn't be better! Strictly and Christmas and Neil Jones. Neil! We have a message from somebody who loves you and couldn't wait to watch this dance. Hello, lovely Mel. You know me, I love a good laugh and I love a banging tune, so, when I heard about what you were doing for Strictly, I thought, \"Great! That's two things ticked off my Christmas list!\" Well done and have a merry Christmas. Gorgeous Ade! He's so great. My favourite thing in training, when people start training, they'll take a flask, sometimes they'll take some fruit. You had to have a sleeping bag, am I wrong? Full sleeping bag plus blankets, sometimes on top, if it was a bit chilly, because I need a little kippingtons every day. An hour and a half. 22 minutes, usually. There you go. Good luck. Thank you. The scores are in. Thank you. The judges have their scores. Craig Revel Horwood. APPLAUSE AND CHEERING Craig! Motsi Mabuse. What?! Shirley Ballas. And Anton Du Beke. APPLAUSE AND CHEERING I want to say that's my first 40, but it's my first 10, I think. Neil's first ten! And your first 40, you are joint top of the leaderboard. I need to unzip. Am I dreaming this? Unzip it. Don't do it. No, no. I don't know what's underneath. Do whatever you need to do. Moisture and gas. OK. Moisture and gas. Happy Christmas, everyone. Sorry! Our Christmas stars have all danced, but there is still more to come. Moisture and gas - no, other things. They will be taking to the floor once more for a Yuletide group number, but, before that, let's take a look at the leaderboard. Remember, the judges' scores are only half the story. Our studio audience are ready to vote for their favourites, and their votes could change everything. But, first, we have one more Christmas cracker for you. Performing Wonderful Christmas Time, please welcome the very brilliant Gary Barlow. APPLAUSE AND CHEERING Happy Christmas, everyone! OK, here we go. # The mood is right # The spirit's up # We're here tonight # And that's enough # Simply having # A wonderful Christmas time # The party's on # The feeling's here # That only comes # This time of year # Simply having # A wonderful Christmas time... # Everybody! # Simply having # A wonderful Christmas time # The choir of children Sing their song # They practise all year long # Ding dong ding dong # Ding dong ding # Ding dong ding dong Ooooh # Ding dong ding dong Ooooh # The word is out # About the town # To lift a glass # And, no, don't look down # Simply having # A wonderful Christmas time # Simply having # A wonderful Christmas time # The choir of children Sing their song # They practise all year long # Ding dong ding dong # Ding dong ding dong # Ding dong ding dong Oooh # Ding dong ding dong Oooh # We're simply having # A wonderful Christmas time # Simply having # A wonderful Christmas time # Oh, oh-oh-oh # A wonderful Christmas time # Simply having # A wonderful Christmas time... # OK, everyone, gather round. One last time. # All together, sing this Christmas song! # APPLAUSE AND CHEERING Thank you to Gary and our professional dancers - Amy, Cameron, Oti and Nikita. We are moments away from announcing our Christmas champions, but, before we do, here's a reminder of all of tonight's performances. APPLAUSE AND CHEERING # Children playing, having fun # It's the season, love and understanding # Merry Christmas, everyone. # # He knows when you're awake # He knows when you've been bad or good # So be good, for goodness' sake! # You better watch out, you'd better not cry # You better not pout, I'm telling you why # Santa Claus is coming to town. # # I want to wish you a Merry Christmas # I want to wish you a Merry Christmas # I want to wish you a Merry Christmas # From the bottom of my heart. # # God bless Hooky Street # Viva Hooky Street # Long live Hooky Street # C'est magnifique, Hooky Street # Magnifique, Hooky Street. # # And may all of your Christmases # Baby, may your days, may your days # Be merry, be merry # Merry and bright. # # Ice ice baby # Vanilla ice ice baby # Vanilla ice # Yo, man, let's get out of here # Word to your mother! # APPLAUSE AND CHEERING Six fantastic performances, but only one couple can win. It's time to reveal our Christmas champions. The results are in. Fred and Dianne, Anton said your quickstep flew across the floor and the footwork was incredible. Moira and Aljaz, Motsi said your salsa was a Christmas wonder and she absolutely loved it. Anne-Marie and Graziano, Craig had only one word for your cha-cha - fab-u-lous. Jay and Luba, Shirley said your jive had lovely timing and was a real treat. Adrian and Jowita, Anton said your American smooth was glorious, wonderful and sophisticated. Mel and Neil, Motsi said your street dance was pure fun, the best way to close the Christmas special. Thank you. We've combined the studio audience votes with the judges' scores and we're about to find out who will be taking home the Strictly Christmas Trophy. I can now reveal that the Strictly Come Dancing Christmas champions 2021 are... DRUMBEAT AUDIENCE CLAP ALONG ..Anne-Marie and Graziano! APPLAUSE AND CHEERING Congratulations! ANNE-MARIE SQUEALS Anne Marie, is it a proper highlight? Cos you look so moved, which is so lovely. I can't... I... I can't... I actually didn't even hear my name then, I actually heard it after it came out of your mouth, and I am so happy. He wanted it so bad as well, and I'm just so happy... LAUGHTER I'm so happy for him. You are our Strictly Christmas champion. Oh, my God! What would you like to say to Anne-Marie? Actually, for me, it's been an honour since the first day I met her, and I did my best, and she did as well, and this is just, you know, the result of the hard work. She is really busy, but, you see, with the good effort, here we are. Yeah, here we are. APPLAUSE AND CHEERING Congratulations... Oh, my God. ..to both of you. We have huge pleasure in crowning Anne-Marie and Graziano Strictly Come Dancing Christmas champions 2021. APPLAUSE AND CHEERING That is so cool! Well done to our couples. And, as it is Christmas Day, there's always room for one more treat. Rocking Around The Christmas Tree, please welcome our fantastic cast. # Rocking around the Christmas tree At the Christmas party hop # Mistletoe hung where you can see every couple tries to stop # Rocking around the Christmas tree # Let the Christmas spirit ring # Later we'll have some pumpkin pie and we'll do some carolling # You will get a sentimental feeling when you hear # Voices singing let's be jolly # Deck the halls with boughs of holly # Rocking around the Christmas tree Have a happy, happy holiday # Everyone's dancing merrily # In the new old-fashioned way # You will get a sentimental feeling when you hear # Voices singing let's be jolly, deck the halls with boughs of holly # Rocking around the Christmas tree Have a happy, happy holiday # Everybody dancing merrily in the new old-fashioned way # Rocking around the Christmas tree # Rocking around the Christmas tree # Rocking around the Christmas tree # Rocking around the Christmas tree # Rocking around the Christmas tree # Rocking around, rocking around # Rocking around the Christmas tree # Ooh-ohh... # APPLAUSE AND CHEERING Amazing! Yes! Oh... That was an absolute blast. They really are the gift that keeps on giving. Thank you to our Christmas couples, our judges and mostly to you at home for watching. Next on BBC One, it's The Wheel and Blankety Blank. But, for now, there's just one more thing left to do. Does it involve an elasticated waist and a mince pie? Yes. But first... ALL: Merry Christmas! APPLAUSE AND CHEERING "}
{"episode":"m0017phy","subtitles":"ANNE: I didn't know you had dealings with Captain Sutherland. Oh, yes. Curious woman, Miss Lister. Miss Walker has requested a division of the estate. But he seems determined to frustrate the process. Why do people think they can ignore me? It's as if I'm invisible. The Priestleys have been so objectionable to us. But then here it is in black and white - they have had three properties from us. You have to be certain, before we think any further about changing our wills, that this, here, with me, is what you want. KNOCK AT DOOR He's here. It's him. Right. Don't. What? Say anything. What do you mean, \"don't say anything\"? Why have we asked him here if...? Don't say anything aggressive. I wasn't going to say anything aggressive. I was going... We... ..are dignified people. Even in the face of... Especially in the face of adversity. We are good Christian folk, and that one simple fact must guide our every action, and our every response to the actions of others. I know that. I do know that, Eliza. But I don't think we need to mince words. KNOCK AT DOOR DOOR OPENS Mr Washington, ma'am. Sir. Mr Priestley. Mrs Priestley. Thank you for coming. Oh! No trouble, ma'am - only over the road at Crow Nest. Washington. I sent my note to you in your capacity as Miss Walker's land steward, and in view of the fact that when I wrote to her, the servant came back saying she was in York until Monday. That's right, ma'am. With Miss Lister. And so we wondered if you could throw any light on this for us. Sent, I assume, before she left. We are advised to vacate the school premises. Both my day school, of which Mr Priestley is a trustee, hence his presence, and the Sunday school run by Mrs Batty, who is being requested to vacate her cottage. Her home. Ah... Well, yes, I'm afraid it... It does go with the job, yes. Two of your little girls attend my day school. Suzannah is an assistant teacher! And you knew about this? There are other rooms in the village, ma'am, that would accommodate the day school more than adequately. Yes, there are, and we will make use of them. Why, though, Mr Washington? Why? I don't entirely know, ma'am. What do you know, Washington? Well... Mrs Sutherland and Miss Walker are dividing the estate in two. And there have been a number of distresses and evictions in anticipation of the division, and... ..that's as much as I know. Dividing it in two? Yes. You must know as much about it as me, Mr Priestley, but, yes, when Miss Walker's and Mrs Sutherland's brother died intestate, the estate came to them both, jointly, but there was no provision for a formal division as such. I suppose no-one ever imagined it would happen. But... So, yes, Miss Walker is now seeking a formal, itemised division of the estate. Is she? It makes sense. Mrs Sutherland and Miss Walker... They lead very different lives...these days. Well, well. I am sorry if it's inconvenient. And for Mrs Batty, as well. But... ..I'm little more than a messenger. RINGS BELL Is there anything else I can... help you with? I don't think so. DOOR OPENS Thank you for coming, Mr Washington. Mrs Priestley. Mr Priestley. DOOR CLOSES A formal, itemised division of the estate. And we all know who's behind that one, don't we? What is it we're signing again? I-It's a codicil, George. That says Miss Lister is authorised to proceed with the division of my estate if not completed before the event of my death. You're simply signing to say you've seen Miss Walker and Miss Lister sign their names, George. That's all. Just sign it. The contents of the document are immaterial. All you're doing is witnessing that these are indeed their signatures. Which you know them to be because you've just seen them write them. Oh, I see. Sorry. I'm with you. As long as... I just didn't want to, you know, find out I'd joined the Navy or something. Thank you. So that's that. And then regarding your brother-in-law, Miss Walker... Can I, er...? I've written a letter to Captain Sutherland, which I'll send off to Scotland in due course, explaining that I'm now dealing with the matter of the division for you, and, um... Well, let's see what comes back. Mm. What would be helpful, as we get further into it, would be to see a copy of this deed of settlement from 1831 between him and your sister, to see what exactly she did settle upon him. Do you have a copy? No. But you've seen a copy? No, it was only a reference to its existence, but my aunt confirmed it entirely. Well, then perhaps I'll write to your Mr, er...? Parker. Parker. He's not my Mr Parker. Parker in Halifax, and see if I can get a copy from him. And then the other matter, these properties your cousin, Mr Priestley, has \"acquired\" from your uncle. The good news is that it looks like the Blackcastle Waste at High Sunderland is recoverable. Really? Mm-hm. And of course the rents for the period they've been removed from your estate would be recoverable too. Oh. Now, the other two, Longley Farm in Norland and the house at Hall End in Halifax, I'm afraid it may be too late. According to the statute of limitations, if your cousin has had uninterrupted possession for 20 years or more and no-one's raised any objections within that time, which at the moment appears to be the case, it's, unfortunately, something you may have to accept. But I... But I've only just found out about it. Well, I can consult counsel. But surely if a person's only just found out about a thing... What's fair and what's legal aren't always the same bedfellows we might hope them to be, Miss Walker. Mm. Mm. What do you know about John Harper, Mr Gray? The architect. Mr Harper? Well, yes, he's... Parsons was on about him yesterday. He came over to cut mine and Miss Walker's hair. I was telling him about my great disappointment over this local architect I've been bothering with and he insisted that John Harper was my man. Oh, he's excellent. He designed the whole of St Leonard's Street here, including the new theatre - you must've seen it. It's very elegant, and he's so young. He's only 26, but widely regarded as something of a phenomenon. You must snap him up, Miss Lister, if you can. They all say he's destined for very great things. He's the most delightful young man. I was... I was quite charmed by him. I sent him a note, and he turned up at our hotel at ten o'clock sharp the next morning. He only looked about 15. And then the very next morning... This was Thursday just gone. ..he drove over to Halifax in his carriage... We were still in York. ..had a good look at Northgate... Anne sent a note ahead to Mr Greenwood to give him unlimited access... And... Yes, yes, I did. And he's delighted with it. He understands my vision perfectly. He thinks the whole enterprise has every chance of success. Is it going to cost a lot? W-Well, it's not cheap. He's not cheap. But then I shouldn't want to build a cheap hotel, and the returns will reflect the quality of the investment. He's built a whole street in York. Oh, it's very fashionable. We went to study it. He's going to get back to us with a proper plan in a fortnight. Well, I'm glad you decided against selling Northgate. I think this is a much better scheme. Thank you, Aunt. If it works. Cordingley. Ma'am. How are you? Well, ma'am. How was your sister? Very well, ma'am. How's your leg? Your hip. It's... It's... It's... It's, you know... Anyway, welcome back. Miss Walker and I will have our coffee in our little upstairs sitting room. Yes, ma'am. A letter, ma'am, for Miss Walker. Mrs Priestley's servant brought it. \"The dwelling house will be given up at the end of June. \"The school rooms I have given directions \"to be given up to Mr Washington next week, \"along with the books and benches \"belonging to the Sunday school. \"This I sincerely hope you will be able \"to make arrangements to continue with, \"for the sake of the children. Mrs Batty, who is unwell, \"informs me she wishes to decline teaching \"after next Sunday.\" Well, she's certainly got the message. That'll teach her to write anonymous letters. I suppose I should've anticipated having to find a new teacher sooner rather than later. Oh, we'll ask about. And in the interim... ..we'll teach them. Will we? Why not? You should open a new school at Lightcliffe anyway. A day school and a Sunday school. We should take on a good schoolmaster - a married man, with ambition, whose wife can run the Sunday school, and all at your behest. She says she intends to carry on her day school. She says she can procure a room in the village. Free gratis, like she's had it from you? I don't know. I doubt it. I doubt it, too. Has anyone ever given you the least thanks for the use of those rooms all these years? For the day school or the Sunday school? Hm? No. 40 children attend the Sunday school. Excellent. I'm sure we can manage that. CAPTAIN SUTHERLAND: Unbelievable. Your sister has now fully appointed this Jonathan Gray in York to deal with the division of the property, and he expects me to take on a legal man too. What is the matter with her? She's found out about the settlement that I made on you in 1831. Is that her? She's anxious that there should be no further delay. What delay? And now she knows it's you she should be dealing with rather than me, she thought it would be better to... She's ridiculous. She thought it would be better to put the thing more formally into the hands of a legal man. We are going down as soon as we - you - can travel. She knows that. Mm-hm. She did first raise the matter in September, so I suppose from her point of view... Exactly. September. It's less than... ..nine months ago. So from her point of view, it could look like we're dragging our heels. I don't suppose it's occurred to her that I'm just as eager to get on with it as she is, so that I can make a proper settlement on our children... ..without involving overpaid lawyers. What's this? About these properties. High Sunderland, Hall End. Oh, it's, um... Mr Priestley, somehow, years ago, got hold of... ..from my uncle, before the estate came to my father... My aunt used to talk about it, but... Oh, I don't know. I never really knew. And she's taking him to task over it? She wants me, us, to share the legal costs. Yes. Curious. What is? All of it. Everything. The tone of her letters. The... The way she has become so litigious. I half imagined Priestley was behind it, but clearly not. Not if she's taking legal action against him. It's Miss Lister, isn't it? I...I can hear her voice through and through this letter. All the letters we've had lately. So...why... ..would Miss Lister push your sister so forcibly for a division of the property? Why would she suddenly be so... ..\"eager to expedite matters\"? Well... ..why wouldn't she? Miss Lister, she's a great one for getting on with things and... ..not putting off till tomorrow what can be done today. She's not her husband. Perhaps her influence is rubbing off on Ann. Yes. It is. I agree with you. I can feel it in her letters. And it's no bad thing, surely. I was rather pleased with the tone of that. She always sounds so much happier and healthier these days, getting on with her life, engaging with the world around her, rather than hiding away and obsessing about herself. My dear Ann. By today's post I am in receipt of a letter, by your instructions, from Messrs Gray Solicitors, York, and I have also perused your letter to Elizabeth. The natural inference deductible from both pains me in the extreme. There will be room for a bank. But a good bank... You state that in consequence of the settlement Elizabeth made in 1831, she has \"relinquished all control over her property\", and therefore it seems no progress can be made in the division by further correspondence with her. From similar considerations which prompted my wife to make the settlement in 1831, I assure you we have long been anxious for a division of the property, for we could make no definite settlement on our children while half the property on which it was secured belonged to you. This is so obvious that I assure you I was most solicitous that a partition should be offered and also in a measure so fair and equitable that come what may, neither party would have cause to demur. That this partition was never carried into effect, if you recall, is due to you, prior to your sudden departure from us 18 months ago, having requested Elizabeth not trouble or perplex you with matters relating to business. And since your return to Halifax, you have not once hinted at a wish to have the property divided, until this last September when you suddenly intimated it for the first time, and in that same letter also stated that you had given Mr Washington instructions to draw up a scheme of division. Ah, Mrs Rawson and the girls. How delightful. How are you? I'm amazed you have the audacity to show your face in public, Miss Walker. I'm sorry? Not only the way you've treated your family, and your aunt in particular, but this latest humiliation you've inflicted on Mrs Priestley. Oh... Over the Sunday school! CAPTAIN SUTHERLAND: Because Elizabeth is nursing, she cannot properly go south before the end of next month. This I thought you understood. She still hopes it would meet with your concurrence to postpone the division until the period most convenient and desired by her... Thank you. ..and certainly hopes you would not, in the meanwhile, involve her and her children in usurious legal proceedings. I won't write to Mr Gray until I hear from you. I have no objection in the remotest degree to you appointing him to act for you, but I certainly will not appoint a solicitor to act for me in a matter regarding which there is no dispute. If we are to act on Samuel Washington's scheme, which I sincerely hope we will, why adopt legal measures? I am aware all trades must live, but the law is the last one I would feel inclined to patronise. Believe I am, my dear Ann, yours most sincerely, George Mackay Sutherland. Knock, knock. He's saying that he's been itching to get on with the division all along. He... He's a liar. And he's accusing me of wanting to involve Elizabeth and the children in \"usurious legal proceedings\". SHE SCOFFS It's not funny. No, you're right. Men who hide behind their wives and children are not so much funny as absurd. If you're still dwelling on Mrs Edward Rawson's comment in Nicholson's this morning, don't. You asking the Priestleys to vacate the school rooms is none of her business, and she only made herself look foolish. Can you not mention that woman's name in my presence ever again?! Would you like me to pour the tea, Miss Lister? No. Go. What have I asked you before about not speaking to me like that in front of the servants? Are you going to help me write back to him, then, or what? My dear Captain Sutherland. I have this moment received your letter, and rejoice to find that you are quite as anxious for the division of the joint property as I am. I fear... ANN: I fear you will not serve much by being your own attorney, but you will judge as you think best. I myself feel persuaded that in employing Mr Gray to act for me, I spare myself and others much trouble, and adopt not only the best plan, but the cheapest one. ANNE, DICTATING: The deed of settlement of February 1831 is so comprehensive that all power respecting the making good of titles, etc, seems vested solely in you. There is not, therefore, any necessity in hurrying my sister to Yorkshire. I shall always be delighted to see her, but I earnestly hope that you will be here before the end of next month. I am much obliged to you... ANN: ...obliged to you for your so kind consideration in having complied with my request to trouble me as little as possible about business during the time I was recovering in York. It seems Elizabeth must have forgotten to tell you that immediately on my return from the Continent last year, I wrote to tell her of the perfect recovery of my health, and that I was ready and desirous to apply myself to business immediately and diligently and make up for lost time. Is that her? Seriously. I ask you. Is that her voice? So...precise, so to-the-point. She wants her moiety, she wants her share... Yes, of course, and she will have it. I always intended to go along with Washington's original proposal for the division anyway. Did you? Yes! Subject to our visit. But that aside, how much do we really know about Anne Lister? Hmm? How much do you really know about Anne Lister? Ma'am, Mr Harper's here. Mr Harper. Miss Lister. How are you? Oh, good Lord, look at this. Look at this fellow with his wheelbarrow. The owls! Oh, and the monkeys. And this little person wielding a mace! I wonder what he's going to do with that? Extraordinary. And the colours. Yes, it's... I'm looking for the Lister coat of arms. Not there. The Waterhouses put this window in during the 16th century, just before we acquired the place. Some of the glass is much older than that - taken from some church or other during the dissolution of the monasteries. So possibly older than the house itself, which was built in 1420. Ah! My uncle always maintained this is very probably amongst the oldest stained glass in England. The world. This house is extraordinary. Mm. It is. It's in my blood, it's in my bones, it's in my soul. It's also inconvenient, and draughty, Mr Harper, compared to some of my better friends' houses. And if the mill chimneys creep any higher up the hill from Halifax and the barbarians come knocking on our door, I've always fancied I'd sell up and go and live quietly on a hill above Grenoble. Oh, don't ever leave Shibden, Miss Lister. Your better friends' houses may be less draughty and more convenient, but this has true character, and that's priceless. And it suits you. Where can I spread my papers? This is thrilling. I feel rather bilious. It's spot on, it's... It's perfect. It was only when I got through Leeds I realised I'd left York without eating anything. Can I sit down? Oh! RINGS BELL You can't not eat, Mr Harper. I just forget. Oh, I'm the same. Could I have a small cup of tea? You need a wife. I live with my brother. He's an attorney. Well, that's no good. Oh! Is he? George! Ask Mrs Cordingley to get Mr Harper some breakfast, quickly. Eggs, bacon, bread, butter...fruit? Just a small slice of bread and a thin scrape of butter would be more than... And bring us some tea. Immediately. And bring the sugar! We'll sort you out, Mr Harper. This is... Do you know, it's as though you can see into my... ..innermost thoughts and desires. Oh, good. Ideally, I'd find local merchants for the stone and timber and so forth. If you could recommend people, that would be useful. And local craftsmen, too. Joiners, plasterers. I know them all. I'll meet anyone you consider suitable. I always meet several people for any one job and then make a decision. Suppliers and craftsmen. All in consultation with you, of course. I shall take on a site manager, and he'll be here throughout the build, he'll come to live in Halifax for the duration. Ideally a fellow called Husband, if he's available. I've worked with him a number of times, I think you'll be pleased. He'll be my eyes and ears. When can you start? I should think we could begin clearing the site for the foundations next month. I'd like a ceremony. A public ceremony. To lay the first stone, a foundation stone. Then all Halifax can come and see what we're doing. Of course. Excellent. Oh, and we must be clear, before we get too giddy about it, with the proposed shops, the building costs will go up to nearer the \u00a36,000 mark, which means you'd perhaps be looking at an annual rent of nearer 400 than 300. And only you know whether Halifax is a busy enough town to support something like that. What's your impression of Halifax? It isn't York. Your clientele would predominantly consist of trade and people passing through from one destination to another. But my impression is there's no shortage of money here, and increasingly so, with all these... creeping mill chimneys. SHE CHUCKLES You want to borrow another \u00a34,500? On bond, at 4%. The alternative, which I'm inclining towards, would be to sell six of my Navigation shares now and perhaps the rest at Christmas, if I can get 400 guineas each for them. But you spoke so eloquently less than six months ago at the shareholders' meeting about investing more money in the Navigation. So to sell your shares now - might that not look rather lacking in integrity? No. No, I don't think so. Well...would it, could it not look like you were... ..jumping ship? Really? How? The Northgate Casino will have stabling for upward of 70 horses, Mr Parker. I wish I'd have brought the plans to show you, I mean, they're splendid. Mr Harper has excelled himself. Would I be investing so heavily in a coaching inn if I was worried about the arrival of the railways? No, the railways will arrive in Halifax last, Mr Parker, for the same reason the canals did. Because, like Rome, Halifax is built on too many hills. No, I'd be taking from one sound investment to fund another. Whoa! George? Where's George? Ooh! I don't know, ma'am. Tell him to deal with the britzka and Smiler and Merlin. Ah. Mr Washington's helped me come up with five different proposals to send to Captain Sutherland, as you suggested, all based on his original proposal for the division. I merely pointed out to Miss Walker that if she sent Captain Sutherland just the one proposal he'll no doubt find fault with it, quibble, and drag his heels again, whereas if he's presented with a choice, he's more likely to engage with the thing, and, hopefully, plump for one of them. Tactics. Not that it's got anything to do with me, obviously. The only really significant amendment I've suggested is putting either John Farrer's field or Bouldshaw Farm and Clough in Lot 1. They're both worth \u00a31,400, give or take, and it seems to go some way towards balancing the two lots up more evenly. Well, as I say, nothing to do with me. Then we can either draw for the lots or I can make it clear to him that I would prefer Lot 1, being made up of one contiguous piece of land. It would make sense. Whereas Lot 2 is made up of parcels of land here, there and everywhere - Lindley, Golcar, Saddleworth. Which would make very little difference to Mr and Mrs Sutherland, being so far away. As long as it's managed. Well... Again, if it was me - which it isn't - I'd give him the choice. Say that you'd prefer Lot 1, for reasons of contiguity, but if he'd prefer to draw lots you'd be perfectly happy with that as well. And I'd put Bouldshaw Farm and Clough in Lot 1 rather than John Farrer's field. It's got coal in it. Are we all set for Sunday again, Mr Washington? Yes, I am. I'm quite enjoying it. I'm wondering if I've missed my vocation! SHE LAUGHS \"Now, the road from Jerusalem to Jericho \"is steep and treacherous,\" Jesus explained, \"full of desperate men and thieves.\" Perhaps the traveller didn't know that, or perhaps he did, but he had to make his journey anyway. What do you think, Hannah? Yeah. Yeah. The sun was hot and the traveller was tired. He was only five miles from Jericho when, suddenly, he found himself pounced upon. He was beaten mercilessly, stripped naked, robbed of his few belongings, and left for dead at the side of the road. \"Surely the priest will help me,\" the poor man thought as he lay helpless and bleeding in the road. But the priest walked past him as though he hadn't even seen him. Emily. Emily, don't do that, you might get your finger stuck. Some time later, a Levite approached. \"Surely the Levite will help me,\" thought the man. But as the Levite got closer, he crossed to the other side of the road and walked quickly away. The bastard. Next came along a Samaritan, on a horse. \"Oh, no!\" thought the poor man. \"The Samaritan is a foreigner and my enemy. \"He will never help me.\" And then Euclid postulated, and this isn't as complicated as it sounds, if a straight line intersects two other straight lines, and so makes the two interior angles on one side of the first line less than two right angles, then the other two straight lines will meet at a point, if extended far enough on the side on which the angles are less than two right angles. Yes? Yes? Yes. And so, from these five postulates or axioms, Euclid deduced a greater number of theorems or propositions. Yes, Charlotte? What's all that got to do with Jesus, though, sir? GIRL: Miss! CHARLOTTE: Miss. Well, Euclid believed, as I do, that the laws of nature were but the mathematical thoughts of God. God created the world and every magical, majestic thing in it, and do you know something, Charlotte? The leaves, the trees, the birds, the bees - all of it, at some level, comes down to mathematics. Mathematics is the basis of everything. Everything in Creation. Isn't that extraordinary? THUMPS DESK The thoroughness of God's planning. QUIETLY: Me and Henry Hardcastle once saw her snogging Miss Walker! Right. I was thinking about a trip to London. A holiday, before the work at Northgate really begins. I could see some of my friends, and I could finally get my travelling carriage back from Baxter's. We could make some enquiries about a proper master for the day school, and you could consult a doctor, a really good doctor, about your neck. I'd like that. I'd like to go to London again. Hopefully, this business with the Sutherlands will be settled by then too. I'd like to meet your London friends. GASP NEARBY Did you hear something? GASPING Do you think someone's spying on us? Here. Oh! PANTING THEY GASP Stay. Er... What, what is it? Ooh! Go home. IN FRENCH: ANNE IN FRENCH ANN LAUGHS Well, then, you leave me no choice. Because I will not have a disrespectful household. He's only 18! How old's she? 26. That's... I know. I know. What do you want me to do? I'll write to Mr Thomas at the servants' register in York, but... Oh, I don't know. It took me long enough to find him! I can't start seeing to Father's... ..personal needs, it's... No! No, no, no, no. I certainly can't. It's not ideal, but we must keep him on as long as it suits us and in the meantime, be on the lookout for someone else. And not a word to Aunt Anne about this ridiculous business. Ah. Aunt. You've found them. These are Mr Harper's plans for the Northgate Casino. I thought everyone might like to have a look at them. Father? And then I can address any questions... No, thank you. ..or observations anyone might have. Take no notice of your father. He just thinks you might ruin yourself. And all of us. Oh, look at that. Oh, that's the front door, Miss Lister... Aunt. Aunt. ...with the Lister coat of arms above it. And look at this. Above the fireplace, your family motto - justus propositi tenax. Just and true of purpose. Just so. Humbug. Shall we sit down? Yes, let's. Very good. Do you know, I always want to say \"bumhug\" whenever anyone says \"humbug\". I don't know why. THEY LAUGH The only anxiety I have about Northgate, Father, is getting it licensed, what with Christopher Rawson being so difficult. I did speak to Washington about it. Well, Christopher Rawson isn't the only magistrate in Halifax. Yes, but I need two signatories and if he gets wind of it... What about Colonel Dearden and his son? Aren't they both magistrates? Mm. Well, send him a note. Ask him to pop in. Oh! Oh, thank you. This is impressive, eh? And certainly would be a great boon to the town. Another good inn with a large handsome room is just what we need. I intend to call the large room the Casino. Oh! The enterprise may not make a great profit, at least not in the first year, but then mercantile speculation is not my aim. I want to take a pride in the thing and do it for the good of the town. The whole enclave will be elegant, and even, dare I say it, fashionable. Well, I can't imagine there'd be any reasonable objection to granting you a licence. I can certainly answer for myself and for my son. Of course, I'll have to consult with the other magistrates on the matter. But I only need the two signatures? Oh, yes. Yeah. Well, strictly speaking. Um, while I'm here... Yes? ..could I trouble you for a subscription to Mr Wortley's brother's fund for the West Riding? Mr Wortley's brother? John. You may not yet have heard. There'll be no by-election in the town. It seems that Charles Wood has turned down high office specifically in order to avoid one. He's taken some more lowly role in the Admiralty, whereas Lord Morpeth has been made Chief Secretary for Ireland, so John Wortley will contest him for the West Riding. Mm. But, so... .does that mean Mr Rawson won't be standing for Halifax after all, then? No. So, um, could I put you down for \u00a350? I've got seven or eight other people of good long standing in the town down for 50. I shall turn over the leaf and give 30. Can I not persuade you to give 50, Miss Lister? Had Mr Rawson still been standing, he should have had every vote I could influence. I told him that to his face, and I meant it. But the fact is, he doesn't behave handsomely towards me. Over my coal. And I'd hate to spend significant money on Northgate only to find my attempt to license such a worthy public endeavour blocked by him on no more than a whim. So you could put me down for 50, Colonel Dearden, but... ..I will need my licence. HE CHUCKLES You'll have your licence, Miss Lister. Any sign of rain, young man? Not at the moment, sir. Go on. How big is this farm? MUMBLING NERVOUSLY: 24 acres. Speak up! 24 acres. Mm. Imagine, Matthew, if you were to be parted from Eugenie for, I don't know, two years. Do you believe that you would feel the same way about...marrying her? I dare say. You dare say? If nothing happened. Like...what sort of thing? If, um... If Eugenie felt t'same way, too. Well, Matthew, I only hope you've thought the thing through. I can't quite see Eugenie amongst pig tubs and cattle, but you must judge for yourselves. If I were to just leave, ma'am, please, would you let Eugenie keep her job? You going or staying makes no difference as to what happens to Eugenie, Matthew. But... ..now I know your intentions are to marry, Miss Marian and I will think about what to do. You do know that letter hasn't got a postmark on it, don't you? Mm. It's dated the 15th. I only gave her notice on the evening of the 14th. SHE SIGHS They're transparent. They've got us over a barrel. It's so hard to get people these days. So how's it been left? SHE SIGHS Well, I'm taking at face value their claim that they want to get married, although I don't believe that for a second, and I've retracted Eugenie's notice on the understanding that Matthew is looking for a job and when he finds one, they'll marry. Do you think the other servants know about it? SHE SIGHS I don't know. I'm so glad we've decided to go to London. It'll be the perfect tonic. You've had too much tiresome nonsense to bother with, with this wretched division business. It's silly, but... What? What is? I always imagined that one day I might meet lords and ladies, in London. I mean, I know we have to be careful, but... ..I might meet one or two, one day. Mightn't I? Mm. One day... ..if you're very good. Mm. CAPTAIN SUTHERLAND: As you state you will take Lot 1 as drawn up in Washington's original proposal, provided you get Bouldshaw Farm and Clough, I agree to this proposal... \"..agree to this proposal, \"and consider therefore the division formally concluded, \"and I assure you, my dear Ann, \"that I sincerely rejoice that it is.\" Very good. I'm surprised he's agreed to it quite so readily, but happen he wants to get on with it just as much as you do. Hm. Or he wants to seem as though he does. And then there's this next bit - \"As we expect being south as early as we can leave home, \"I hope you will have no objection \"to allowing the amendment to the titles to wait until then.\" You see, he's procrastinating, he's still not signing anything. Well, it's a step forward. You've got his agreement in writing, at least. Mm. Oh, and I called in on Mr and Mrs Priestley again yesterday. BOTH: Why? Well, I had a note from him asking me to. So... But he wanted me to tell you that he intends to give up the waste at High Sunderland without hesitation. Really? So that's good news. There won't be any sort of legal wrangle over it. Right. Shall I see you down at Tillyholme stile then, ma'am? Mr Holt and the Mann brothers'll be there already and they won't want to do anything without you. Yes, you go. I'll follow you down. Sorry, sir. Sorry, lad. Clearly, he knows he should never have had it in the first place. Giving it up so easily. It appals me how lax... Fasten your buttons properly! Sorry, ma'am. Sorry, go on. ..how lax and...profligate my family have been with our property when I see how particular you are with yours. Coal, stone, hotels - you make every square inch of your land work. Well, then, you must take example from me and make yours work so too. I am... I am doing, I-I'm going to. And that's why I won't stand for any more of this...nonsense. What's the matter? He says I knew about the deed of settlement in 1831. He says he told me all about it and I've obviously forgotten. He didn't. Hm. Parker's coming at four this afternoon, I'd better get on. What time do we expect you back from Hebden Bridge? Oh, I don't know. I suspect it'll be a wasted trip. I don't think anyone wants to take over the Sunday school. CLOCK CHIMES FOOTSTEPS Ah! Mr Parker. Well, how... How are things on the estate? Oh, we are winning, I think, one way or another. Mr Holt thinks this time next year my collieries will be the best hereabouts and will pay off all the expense incurred within the first three years of production. Hm? Er, not for me. What have you got for me? I've got 23 notices against trespassers shooting and hunting on your land which all need signing. And I've got two notices to quit - one for Mr Carr for those acres that you need back down at Wellroyd. Those need signing too. Then regarding selling your Navigation shares, well, I've asked around. Mr Robert Waterhouse has no objection to taking the six that you're offering for sale, but he won't give 400 guineas. He will, however, give \u00a3405. No-one will give 400 guineas. Mr Abbott tells me that Mr Louis Alexander has had three of his shares on sale for some time now at 400 guineas apiece, and they've not sold. I hope no other names were named in the matter. But I thought... Is he not soon to be family, Mr Abbott? No. And if he is, well then, I've made it clear to Marian that she and I... That'll be it. Oh. Oh, I'm sorry. No, no other names were named. I'll take Mr Waterhouse's \u00a3405. Anything above \u00a3400 is clear gain as far as I'm concerned, and it's better this way. Borrowing would cost me 10% in the first year. No building would pay for that. Miss Lister. Anne. Is this whole enterprise not a risk? Yes, of course. Of course it is. BOTH LAUGH HE CLEARS THROAT How's Miss Walker? Oh, she's out. She's ridden to Hebden Bridge to speak to a possible candidate for the Sunday school. I, er, had a letter yesterday. From York, from Mr Gray, who's acting for Miss Walker in the matter of the division of the joint property. That's right. He's requested from me a copy of the 1831 settlement between Captain and Mrs Sutherland. He's sent me a letter from Captain Sutherland, which he believes is sufficient authority for me to send him a copy of the settlement, and I... I don't think it is. It's rather vague about \"affording every possible assistance\". And my question is, in my position.... ..would you send it... ..or even an extract from it, without a more clear yea or nay from Captain Sutherland about the specific document in question? I have not a word to say on the matter, Mr Parker. Why are you asking me? I suppose because it's... It's delicate. It's, er... It's complicated. Surely the solution would be to write to Captain Sutherland yourself asking for his permission regarding the document. Yes... Yes. Yes, that's... That's what I shall do. Am I missing something? You... Your family... ..are very good, very old, very valued clients of, er, Parker & Adam. And now that Miss Walker is here as your...companion, I suppose the anxiety is I'm going to find myself between a rock and a hard place in the matter should it become problematic. Why would it? It's a simple enough division, and he's already agreed to it. Mr Gray implied that Miss Walker was angry. To have discovered the settlement. Mm. And there was a further implication that I had not acted professionally... ..in the matter. With her family being opposed to it, and with the settlement appearing to go so much against the wishes in her father's will. But I can assure you, Miss Lister, this was very much what Mrs Sutherland wanted, there was certainly no underhand collusion on my part, and nothing I did was unprofessional, and Miss Walker herself knew... ..perfectly well what was going on at the time, just as the rest of the family did. Captain Sutherland made it abundantly plain to her. She says not. Well... ..she wasn't well. Well, then, how odd of him to burden her with it. Hm? Anyway, it barely matters. What's material is that we now know, she now knows, that it's him that she should have been dealing with all along, and not her sister. Indeed. Well, then. As you suggest... ..I shall write to him. Yes. And do leave me out of it. It really has nothing to do with me. ANN: My dear Captain Sutherland, I am glad that by your agreement to one of my proposals, the division of the estate is so easily arranged. I am anxious that no time should be lost in preparing the deeds. I have, for some weeks, had the deed box here with me at Shibden Hall, I shall go to York as soon as I hear from Messrs Gray, with all the necessary papers... ANN: ..with all the necessary papers, of which Mr Parker, or anyone you think proper, may come here and take a catalogue. I hope the papers will be ready for signing before the end of the month. But should you not be able to come to Yorkshire so soon, then surely the papers can simply be sent to you for your signature. FOOTSTEPS This gets more and more... What? What? The deeds! The Crow Nest deeds have... ..for some weeks, been at Shibden Hall. Why? Your sister! Is being played for a fool! It's bizarre. No. It's beyond bizarre, it is sinister. I tried to protect her. And this, this... SHOUTS IN FRUSTRATION My dear Parker. I acknowledge receipt of your... My dear Parker. I acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 22nd. My dear Parker. I acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 22nd of June and in reply I have no objection to furnishing Mr Gray with the copy of the deed alluded to. In fact, I am most anxious, as I invariably have been, to afford every assistance in endeavouring to have the property of the late Mr Walker fairly and amicably divided. I have stated repeatedly that Mrs Sutherland and I would proceed south and arrange the whole matter as immediately as the season and her health would permit, and when the titles could be given to both parties to whom they were apportioned. I requested that the boxes containing the deeds should remain until then in the bank where I had placed them. I find instead from a letter received just this morning from Miss Walker that the deeds have been taken from the bank and have for some weeks been at Shibden Hall. I do not blame Miss Walker for this, but those who, from selfish, wicked and unnatural motives, endeavour to bias her mind. Miss Lister states for Miss Walker, for I am certain she would never do so, that the object in employing Mr Gray is with the view not to perplex and mystify but to simplify. This is, I trust, some attack on you. As our properties and Miss Lister's join, I cannot help expressing my extreme upset that the titles have been there, at Shibden Hall, which I should of course have decidedly objected to had I known. What is going on, I know not. But the moment our little boy is over the whooping cough, I shall, and Mrs Sutherland if all is well, visit Miss Walker, and this I hope in the course of a very few weeks. My feelings I impart to you in the strictest confidence. Yours most sincerely, George Mackay Sutherland. "}
{"episode":"m00149lg","subtitles":"The relationship between plants and humans is extraordinary. We've been adapting to each other for as long as we've been on the planet. We rely upon plants for almost everything. The air we breathe, the water we drink, the food we eat, much of the clothes we wear, in some parts of the world, the very buildings in which we live. But that relationship is now changing. How it changes next will shape the future of our green planet. Some plants have the ability to live alongside us... ..even when we make it extremely difficult for them to do so. This is Piccadilly Circus in the heart of London. It would be difficult to imagine a more hostile place for a plant. And yet, even here, plants will find a way. Plants like this may seem to follow us wherever we go. We call them, perhaps a little unkindly, weeds. In fact, these plants are pioneers, the ones that are most able to take advantage of new habitats, even very harsh ones. This wall is at least 100 years old. It's like a sheer cliff face with no sign of soil, and yet this ivy-leaved toadflax thrives here. How? The plant grows towards the light with its flowers facing outwards to attract pollinators. But once they've succeeded in doing that and the seed pods start to develop, its behaviour changes. For now, the pods turn and grow away from the light, seeking the darkest place they can find. A crevice, perhaps, like this one. It's all the toadflax needs. It can now germinate and start to produce a new plant. Other pioneers have a different strategy. They instead distribute their seeds far and wide in great numbers. Sow thistles are masters of this trick. Each of its seeds is equipped with a tiny downy parachute, which will catch the slightest breeze. And they can travel extraordinary distances. They can rise a mile high in the sky and reach places hundreds of miles away from the parent plant. The seeds only need to find the tiniest chink and they can take hold. We barely notice many of these plant invaders. But here in the heart of Hong Kong, strangler fig seeds that landed on a stone wall generations ago, have spread their flexible branching roots far and wide. They can be anchored so firmly that they become a part of the city's architecture. This is perhaps the ultimate weed. But there are places where the extraordinary abilities of fig trees have created a very different relationship with human beings. Meghalaya in north-east India, a high altitude plateau riven by dizzyingly steep valleys. It's home to the Khasi people... ..who've learned how to use the remarkable properties of fig trees to help them live in such difficult country. As in Hong Kong, the tree's numerous roots anchor it firmly, here to steep mountainsides. These roots can grow up to 2.5cm a day. They are unusually strong, flexible, and can develop into a multitude of shapes. The Khasi persuade them to provide them with stairs. The monsoon season brings a seemingly insurmountable challenge for Khasi communities. This is the wettest place in the world. Nearly 30cm of rain can fall in a day. Rivers become lethal torrents, dividing communities from each other. This is when the relationship between fig trees and the Khasi becomes most important. They deliberately plant fig trees near the rivers. When they're mature enough to have developed many hanging roots, Shining Star Kongthaw begins working with them. He guides the roots through bamboo tubes that are pointed towards the opposite river bank. These strands will combine as they grow, sharing nutrients and resources and becoming stronger than a lone strand could ever be. As the years pass, the growing roots become a living bridge. As they grow, they become ever stronger and more stable. This unusual relationship has allowed the people here to thrive in an otherwise challenging landscape. But there are plants that have found a deeper partnership with us, and in doing so, have changed landscapes across the globe. It began over 10,000 years ago, with plants that we found especially good to eat. At first, this relationship created challenges of its own. Many of the ancestral grasses, like these wild oats from Israel, have a trick to ensure that their seeds are planted in the perfect place. Each seed head, at the top, carries two long bristles called awns, and when a seed drops to the ground, these awns do something truly extraordinary... ..they walk. The awns twist as they dry out during the day, and then when they get wet... ..they untwist. Tiny hairs grip on to the ground, keeping the individual moving forward. In this way, the seeds work their way along the ground until eventually they find a rock to hide under or a crack to drill in to. This adaptation is useful for the plant, but not for us. It's hard to collect seeds when they drop off and walk away. So our ancestors selected plants whose seeds don't drop off, don't have legs and don't bury themselves out of reach. They also selected those individuals which put their energy into developing much larger seeds. Close relationships like this have developed all over the world, producing the plants that are now our crops. This may seem a poor deal from the point of view of plants, but not so. We eat their seeds, but in return, we cherish and cultivate them, and now they are widespread and far more abundant than their wild ancestors. You might call this a bargain between ourselves and plants, and over the years, it's proved extraordinarily powerful. In the beginning, the bargain operated on a small scale. Plant, tend and harvest by hand in small patches. Over time, these plants produced more food, increasingly efficiently... ..and the partnerships became more exclusive. We started doing more and more for a small number of chosen species. These few persuaded us to eliminate their competitors, cure their diseases, poison their enemies, and keep them well-watered, even when other species faced drought. Fewer and fewer plant species, like soy, wheat and rice, now occupy more and more land. And so now whole landscapes are dominated by a single species of plant. A monoculture. This is the Central Valley of California, the biggest orchard in the world. A million acres of just one type of tree, almonds. Each flower, if it's fertilised by pollen from a different almond tree, will produce an almond nut. The flowers, patterns and scent have evolved to attract insects and bribe them to do that job for them. The pollen doesn't have to move far, it just needs to reach a neighbouring tree. There are about 20,000 flowers on each tree... ..and 140 million trees. That is billions of flowers all calling out at once. But here, the beauty of the blossom is wasted. To make way for these almond trees, the land was, in effect, wiped clean. Countless wild species of plants and animals were removed, including, critically, pollinators. So now the flowers need help, and lots of it. ENGINE REVS MACHINERY WHIRS LOUD BUZZING 40 billion honeybees... ..trucked in from all over the United States. The orchard is only in bloom for a few weeks, so the almonds need the bees to get to work immediately. Each bee can visit thousands of blossoms a day. And while they take most of the pollen they collect back to the hive, they also drop some pollen at each stop. And, so, with luck, the flowers are all eventually fertilised. Day after day, the process is repeated. Flower after flower. Tree after tree. By the time the petals fall, 2.5 trillion flowers have been successfully pollinated and will now grow in to 2.5 trillion almonds. This type of intensive, streamlined agriculture produces amazingly high yields. But monocultures are fragile. While they can function effectively when conditions remain stable, it only takes a small change to create catastrophe. Lodgepole pine, a very valuable timber tree grown extensively in western Canada. Millions of acres of the same species, all the same age and the same size. For centuries, lodgepole forests have lived in a natural balance with their enemies, including this one, the mountain pine beetle. In summer, female beetles start hunting for a suitable nursery in which to lay their eggs. The ideal site is a mature lodgepole pine with bark thick enough to feed a female's brood and, critically, to protect them from the bitter cold of the coming winter. Once under the bark, she tunnels upwards... ..laying her eggs as she goes. A single female beetle can lay 100 eggs in a season. When the larvae hatch, they grow by feeding on the inside of the bark. As they do, they damage the channels that transport water and nutrients between the roots and needles. For centuries, the freezing northern winters killed the majority of larvae, so tree and beetle remained in balance. But now, with the climate changing, the winters aren't cold enough to control the beetle numbers. Needles turning red are a sure sign that the trees are dying. The beetle plague spreads like wildfire across a landscape covered by a monoculture of similarly vulnerable trees. Since the first mass outbreak 40 years ago, trillions of trees in North America have been killed by the mountain pine beetle. Loss of plant diversity makes any habitat more vulnerable to changing conditions. Now, with climate changing so fast, we are losing plant diversity just when we need it the most. Two out of five plants are now facing extinction. Of course, the loss of any one species is in itself a tragedy, but such a loss erodes the stability of a whole ecosystem, and that should be of great concern for all of us. We need an insurance policy, a hedge against extinction. This is Kew's Millennium Seed Bank. Packets of seeds arrive here from all over the world. These are from a relative of the yucca plant, which grows in central Mexico on the slopes of volcanoes, and nowhere else. Most of the seeds are from plants that are threatened. Some indeed, have gone extinct since their seeds arrived here. But here, at least, those seeds are safe. When they arrive, they're processed and sealed in to airtight jars. Seeds are then brought underground to be stored in a vault, like this one, at -20C. Since the bank was founded, two billion seeds from 40,000 different species have been brought and stored here. Because a seed contains everything it needs to start a new plant, each and every one of them represents a little grain of hope... ..hope that one day we will make it possible for the seeds of these rarities to grow in the wild once again. The seed bank certainly gives us options when a species becomes rare or even extinct. But around the world, people are trying ways to keep natural plant populations healthy where they should be, in the wild. Hawaii. 90% of the plant species here are found nowhere else in the world. Many are threatened by a plant invader called Miconia. It was brought to the island of Maui in the '70s as an ornamental plant. In its native Mexico, it grows in balance with a rich variety of predators, competitors and diseases. It grows taller than most native Hawaiian vegetation, and little can grow beneath it. On the island of Maui, with nothing to keep it in check, it creates a stifling monoculture. Miconia, it would appear, is doing very well for itself. But today it's under attack. On level ground, a single dedicated team can keep Miconia in check. But unfortunately, this plant can spread to places impossible for people to reach on foot. Just one plant can produce around ten million seeds a year, enough to cover this entire landscape. With so much at stake, the team have come up with an extraordinary plan. It's too dangerous to land here, but they don't need to. A marksman with great skill can shoot the Miconia with paint balls full of herbicide. A perfect shot is one that hits the stem, so ensuring that the herbicide spreads throughout the plant. The method is so precise that with careful flying and accurate aim, they can kill the intruders without damaging any wild plants. Destroying alien invaders is not the only way to help the native plants here. This is Waikamoi Preserve, the last surviving fragment of a high-altitude Hawaiian rainforest, and home to one of the world's rarest plants. Holokea. There are only 57 fully-grown individuals left in the wild. Their peculiar flowers evolved to suit the beak of a bird found only in Hawaii, the 'i'iwi. The bird is now so rare itself that, today, these partners seldom, if ever, meet. So the chances of holokea getting pollinated are very slim. But a strange new partnership might just save it. I look at losing a plant as flying in a plane and taking a screw out and, yeah, the plane will fly and you might be able to take a couple of screws out and keep flying, but eventually you're going to crash. Hank knows where to find every one of the last 57 plants, and he returns every year to act as their pollinator. We have to step in and play that role as pollinator or matchmaker. Hank collects the pollen from the male flower and dusts it onto a female flower of a different plant. He's currently their life support, but his goal is for holokea to thrive without him. So, before he leaves, he plays the call of the 'i'iwi bird. 'I'IWI BIRD CALLS Hank hopes the sound will attract the living birds, and if they come, that they will reconnect with the last holokea and rekindle their vital relationship. I believe all species are important and I believe we have a duty to act. We need to act, not only in the wild places, but even in those where we live and where we farm. Like much of the world, Kenya is losing thousands of native trees annually. Ones that local people rely on for so much, especially fuel. But here, people have come up with an ingenious way to reverse some of that loss around them. At a factory in the outskirts of Nairobi, workers collect and sort waste charcoal dust. Seeds of carefully selected native trees are mixed with the dust. This carbon coat will protect the seeds from hungry animals until the rains arrive. These are seed balls. In the village of Kibwezi, acacia trees are becoming scarce, cut down by previous generations to make charcoal. But the students at this school make forest restoration child's play. The nutrients in the dissolving char dust will give each little seed a good start. If only a handful of these seeds grow into a tree, the effort has been well worth it. Every mature acacia tree can itself produce thousands of seeds a year. 13 million seed balls have been distributed in Kenya alone... ..and the methods by which they're dispersed... ..are ever more inventive, to say the least. This technique is being repeated around the globe. Seed-ball-making workshop. People are choosing seeds of local native plants, giving them a little initial help and bringing some wild plants back into the world around them. But is it possible, even in our most extreme monocultures, to invite a bit of wildness in and, with it, a bit of resilience? I have two different kinds of forage growing in my orchard. The yellow that you see behind me is a variety of different mustards. And then after the bloom, we're going to see some clover blossom. This mix of plants means the bees can feed before and after the brief almond bloom. And they also get a more balanced, healthier diet. In the meantime, it's going to provide habitat for all sorts of insects and the bees, and probably some rabbits. It's a step towards establishing a better, more stable system. It's about finding balance. That's what we're trying to do here. Find a balance. Can humanity globally find a new balance between wild plants and those we have domesticated? Around half the usable land on Earth is taken up by agriculture. Do we really need that much? Maybe not. It's a remarkable fact, but around 80% of all cultivated land is used for raising livestock for us to eat. Raising animals can be a sustainable way to create food, but in many places, plants can produce the same amount of protein on a fraction of the land that animals need. What could it mean for wild plants if the global balance between plant-eating and meat-eating shifted? It may sound odd, but the more plants we eat, the more space there will be for wild plants. Remarkably, it's possible to restock even highly degraded land with wild plants. In Brazil, the needs of cattle ranching drive most deforestation. 30 years ago, the owners of one former cattle ranch wanted to restore their land to the Atlantic rainforest that once covered it. They had no idea if it could be done... ..the land was so bare and eroded. But they were determined to try. First, they cleared the introduced African cattle grasses, invasive plants that outcompete most of the native plants. The grasses were replaced by seedlings grown from seeds gathered in nearby remnants of Atlantic rainforest. The Earth Institute, or Instituto Terra, as the ranch is known now, was encouraged by early success and expanded its scope and ambition. In five years, trees covered the land again, and within ten, it was clear something remarkable was happening. When rain falls, it now no longer simply runs off the land, leaving it parched. Instead, it clings to the plants, to every root, stem and leaf... ..and then slowly filters to the forest floor. ..and, so, previously dry streams burst into life for the first time in decades. The Institute never introduced animals or plants other than the trees. The animals came back on their own. Small ones came first. And then, very recently, camera traps left in the forest captured images beyond the hopes of everyone involved. A maned wolf, an animal that is being driven from its native habitat by deforestation, drawn to its favourite plant, the wolf fruit tree. Not only that... YAPS ..a puma... ..with cubs! The arrival of these precious top predators and their young shows what can happen when we make space for wild plants. We have, for centuries, robbed wild plants of the space and time they need to thrive. That has certainly not been to their benefit. Nor, ultimately, is it to ours. Our relationship with plants has changed throughout history, and now it must change again. Whether it's what we eat and cultivate or whether it's what we like, we must now work with plants and make the world a little greener, a little wilder. If we do this, our future will be healthier and safer and, in my experience, at any rate, happier. Plants are, after all, our most ancient allies, and, together, we can make this an even greener planet. Throughout the Human episode, the Green Planet crew sought to capture the lives of plants confronted with the human world. But they also heard the stories of people deeply connected to the plants around them... ..such as those at the front line of the battle to save Hawaii's native endangered plants from invasive species. If we don't get a handle on Miconia, we could lose everything that makes Hawaii special and unique. But before the Green Planet team could start work, they had to undertake some rigorous preparation. We're going into somewhere that has very... It's a very sensitive ecosystem. They're trying to protect it from invasives. Filming in a place so ravaged by invasive species meant they had to be 100% sure that they were not spreading any non-native stowaways themselves. They had to scrub and disinfect every item of equipment. With kit clean, the team first focus on filming the rare holokea plant... ..accessible only on foot. There are a few pristine areas like this left in Hawaii, only 40% of the land still has native vegetation, most of it wiped out by invasive species like Miconia. Next on the list was to film the team waging war on Miconia, known locally as the purple plague. For crew member Aja, the work is not just a physical battle against this invasive species, it's deeply personal. I've been to the pristine areas, so I know what it looks like and feels like, you know, to be in the presence of all that mana and spirituality. Those aren't just plants. Those are ancestors' spirits, you know? Controlling these invasive plants is a relentless job, and Aja is not just doing this for native Hawaiian ecosystems, but also to protect her ancestral relationship to this fragile landscape. So, going through this, it feels good to hack 'em and pull them out and be like, \"Yeah, OK, take that!\" You know? We can sort of fight back. Aja's fierce passion to protect these native forests is evident, but the purple plague has spread to places Aja could never reach on foot. Taking to the sky is the only way to reach the front line of this battleground. With only enough fuel to stay airborne for two hours, the window for capturing this aerial battle is uncomfortably small. We have one day of doing the heli operations. The weather could completely mess us up if we get a system that comes in, heli to heli is always dangerous and difficult. This flight is not just tense for Liz, for plant sniper Brooke Mahnken, these short flights represent his only opportunity to hold back the invasion. Miconia left unchecked can be terribly damaging. The potential for one seeding plant, if it were to get far away from the population, reach maturity and put seeds out, then it's starting a whole new infestation. And once it occupies that entire area, then it's completely wiped it out. The helicopter is really important because you can fly in extreme terrain with these, like, 1,000ft cliffs and find Miconia that... There would be no other way to get to these plants. The Miconia team are used to the aerial challenges of this battle, but for producer Liz, the pre-fight talk from the helicopter pilot brings home the lengths that this team go to in order to complete their work. So, you're just going to be in the back here and it's a hurricane in the back seat, literally a hurricane, so nothing loose, you don't want to put an arm ahead, a leg or a hand out cos it's going to blow behind you and you don't want to stick your head out because if the headset comes off, then it's into the tail rotor and then it's bye-bye, Maui. Pre-flight checks completed, the clock is now ticking to get into the air. This matters so much to everyone here. I definitely feel the pressure to get this right. INDISTINCT SPEECH To get within shooting distance of the plants, the helicopter pilot must carefully manoeuvre in to one of the area's deepest canyons. See the light-coloured rock? Yep. Follow that up, to the right. You see it? The target is in sight. Oh, yeah. There it is. OK, I'm live and ready. With high winds gusting up from the waterfall, getting into position is tricky enough in one helicopter, let alone two. To give Brooke the best chance of hitting the Miconia, the pilot must get him within 20 metres of the plant and ideally at eye-level. Any missed shot threatens to become friendly fire, harming the species he aims to protect. Ready? Yeah. Here we go. Brooke must strike the stem of the plant to have the best chance of completely killing it. Whoa! My God, nice fire! Yeah, worked really, really well. Thanks, guys. This has been a successful mission for both teams. The pilot's skills and Brooke's sharp shooting has saved another patch of forest, and Liz is relieved that she has the shots she needs to do the story justice. It's over. It's over. It just looked amazing. Yeah, it looks good. It looks good. For Brooke and Aja, however, their work doesn't stop. Just holding back the tide of invasive species in Hawaii is more than a lifetime's work. But Aja believes that her fight is worthwhile. Everything we do is for the next generation, just like our ancestors and kupuna. It wasn't for them, it was for the next generation. And just to have my kids go into areas, like, where they can see there are still natives, where we don't have to go through all this invasive vegetation. You know, it's not just my responsibility, it's everyone's responsibility. You know, the Earth takes care of us, so we have to do the same, we can't just let it go by. We've got to take care, too.

I've got exams next week. I showed you the letter. Are you actually going to do any revising, or what? What, and you did? No. And don't let her tell you any different. Just keep out the way while Nan's mental health nurse comes. Oh, you've got one. No, thank you. What? It's off. It ain't. I said no, thank you. It ain't off, I only bought it yesterday. You drink it, then. All right, fine, if you say it's off, it's off. We'll get some more. Stace, can I have a word? She didn't eat yesterday and today she's not drinking. What next? Because it looks like she's hasn't even had a wash. Here - all because your grandma loves... You do know there are easier ways to surprise her. I do now. What was that, anyway? It was a frying pan. Yeah, I know that. But why were you lurking around in the dark with it? Why aren't you at work? Pete, I'm not an idiot. Evidence is to the contrary. Eh? You are not right. I'm fine. No, I'm worried. You're not fine, you're jumpy, you're angry. You haven't left the house since... I'm scared! All right? I'm scared. And I'm sick of it. And do you know what the worst thing is? I have no idea who done this to me. Or why. And the police, they haven't got a clue. Which means whoever done this is just out there doing whatever they want, and I'm just stuck in here... All right, listen, listen. I've got a plan. Hear me out. We are going to need a computer, a printer and a bottle of brandy. What's the bottle of brandy for? What's the bottle of brandy for? My head. Ow. Do you want my advice? From you? Not really. You've made a mistake. That ain't advice, Kat. Mum! Can you get in the shower? They'll be here in a minute. And I say this with love, but you ain't had a wash for two days and the dressing gown you're wearing ain't had one for six months. I know what you're doing. What? What she's saying is you look a state. That's not what she's doing. Well, what's she doing, then? She's trying to poison me. You want me to be straight with you? Yeah. I've got no idea what I'm looking at. No, listen. Boozers, I'm all over it, but, you know, building plans... Dad! What I will say is that it's going to be the best poke gaff that Walford has ever seen. So the lease - all paid for? All sorted. Yeah. Nice. You know what? The first poke bowl on the house for him. Ooh! Well, let's not go crackers. You know, let's... I'm really happy for you. Thanks. Why don't we make up for the other night - get Scarlett over, we'll have a little film night. What do you reckon? Yeah, I'd love that. Hi. Sorry, I didn't know whether to knock or... I just, um... I wanted to speak to Nancy. Well, you, too, actually, Mick. Anyway, I'm... I'm blabbering. Er, so I'm just going to say it. Say what? I'm sorry. I'm so... ..so sorry. For everything. I, um... I let you down. But I promise that will never happen again, ever. And, Nance, I, um... I know we've had our moments but, er... ..I love you. I love you very much. Thank you. Can I say something now? Hm. Why are you being so weird? Oh, I dunno. Ha. I think it's hormones, or age, or the amount of perfume I inhale living at Sharon's. Maybe you should move. Yeah. Maybe. Why don't you look at the plans for our new business? Oh, no, no, I'll leave that to Mick. Are you taking me to school today? Oh. No, sweetheart, I can't today. Now, Daddy's going to take you. Which, you know, probably means you'll get some sweets on the way, because he's such a soft touch. Right, I, er... ..better get going. Um, I've got some stuff to sort. Cool. See you later. Yeah. See you later. Mum, will you just listen to me? Why, so you can lie to me again? She isn't trying to poison you, Jean. Well, this family's got form. Mum, I wouldn't do that! That dinner you made me, I didn't eat it. Arthur did, and now he's sick. This morning, you gave me milk that smelt funny. You said it was fine, but when I asked you to drink it, you refused! So it all makes sense. Arthur's got a tummy bug. The milk is fine. She hates me. Because she's ashamed of me. Because I'm an embarrassment. And because I gave her this illness. That's not true, Mum. And if you talk like this in front of the nurse, you're going to get sectioned. Maybe that's a good thing. What?! I told you what it was like in there! If she goes back in there, who knows how long it's going to be for? Look at her, look! Do you think she can cope with that? Stop talking about me like I'm not here! Just stop. Everyone stop it. Look. Lily, no, no, no! You're fine, Nan. We all love you, no-one's trying to hurt you. DOORBELL RINGS Who's that? Oh, it's the nurse. DOOR SLAMS HE SIGHS I knew it. That's why you came to the pub, innit - to say goodbye? It was your idea. To get some head space, not to leave, Linda. Why? All I care about, all I have ever cared about in this world is my family. And I've lost them. I've lost everything. No, no, no, you ain't. You ain't lost Nancy. She needs you. She needs her mum. Tell you that, did she? Yeah, she did. When you was at your lowest, all that time she spent trying to make you better, it didn't push her away from you. It made her realise how much she loves you. Don't leave her, Linda, please. You'll break her heart. I don't have a choice. Yes, you do. Every mum that's ever abandoned their child had a choice. My mum had a choice. Ollie's mum has a choice. Don't you talk about my boy. I know what it feels like, yeah? To grow up wondering why your mum abandoned you. I wouldn't wish that on anyone. Do you know what? Ollie, he's young. He might get over it. But Nancy, she won't. I'm telling you, if you walk out of her life right now... ..she'll never let you walk in again. SHE CLEARS THROAT I've got to be honest with you, um... She's not at her best, at the minute. I mean, don't get me wrong, she's been way worse, but since she came home, she's just... She's finding it hard to settle in, you know. Yeah. Yeah, and I just wanted you to know, just in case she says that... Hello. Oh, hello. I'm Jean and, um, this is my granddaughter, Lily. I'm sorry I'm late. She's been doing my hair, which I'm pretty sure is an excuse to not do any revision. So what would you like to know? You really think this is going to work? Yeah, of course. What's going to work? Why are you dressed like that? I'm beginning to ask myself the same question. Whose bright idea was this? It's good, though. No, it's not! No. No, it's not. Why isn't it? Well, I just... I just think some things are best left alone. that's all. Left alone? Well, I'm not leaving it alone. I'm going to find out who did this and I'm going to make 'em pay for it. You know, I would've thought you'd want to help me do that. How do you feel you're being looked after? Well, Stacey's doing the cooking. And it's not good. But that's my fault, because I taught her to cook. JEAN GIGGLES But it's just nice to be home and not have some strange woman wandering into my room at all hours of the day and night. I mean, Kat does it occasionally, but that's usually because Bert and Ernie have lost something. Bert and Ernie are her children. They're not the characters from... I know that they don't live here! But, seriously... ..I'm OK. I have got the support of someone who really loves me, and I don't want to let them down. OK, well, for now, I don't see why anything needs to change. I'll make another appointment and we'll take it from there. I'll see myself out. Well, I've faked some things in my time, Jean... I meant it. When you said you had the support of someone who loves you... I was talking about Lily. I still don't trust you. So from now on, Lily's going to look after me. Anything I eat or drink must be prepared by her. Right, I'm going to switch the immersion on and have a nice long bath. Will you wash my hair? Of course, Nan. Come and help me find a nice soft towel. Cash reward. Do you reckon that'll work? I don't know. Wasn't my idea. Hang on. Here, Jay, I think you're really big. What? You know, for supporting the deaf community, doing the naked photo shoot. Yeah, I never imagined you as a nude model, brother. I never imagined him nude. You won't have to soon. Look, Frankie. Listen, about this thing tonight, right... Oh, yeah, thank you so much for doing it, it really means a lot. Er, just make sure the room's not too cold. Crank up the heat, yeah, baby? Yeah, thank you. Have you finished? Not even nearly. Ah, he can go all day. All day. There you go. There, look. Oh! Oh, you look... Late. And a little bit sweaty, actually. I've got a meeting with a potential supplier. Oh, go. Oh, Nance... ..I'm so proud of you. Aw! I'm proud of you, too. I find that hard to believe. No, Mum, I mean it. What you're doing, admitting that you have a problem, going back to meetings, that's...amazing. A really difficult thing to do, and I'm so proud of you. I want you to know, as well, that if I can help in any way, I'm here. I'm going to be asking for your help with this business SO much. Honestly. I don't understand 50% of what's in these files. I don't. Thank you - for saying that. It means so much. Mum? Yeah. I'm really late now. Oh, go! Go. This is awful. I draw the line at a yellow towel. You can keep that. Right, you have got a problem. I've got several problems, Mother, you're going to have to narrow it down. This. Ben, are you sure no-one else knows about you, besides us? We've been through this. And if the police ain't got nothing, I hardly think Pete is going to crack the case, do you? At least pretend to take this seriously. What do you think I'm doing, eh? You really hurt him, Ben. Yeah, I know. No, you don't know! I'm not just talking about the bruises - he'll get over that - but he's barely left the house since it happened. And you know what it's like to be frightened. Yeah, well, I'll sort something out, yeah? How? I dunno yet. Well, you better think of something. And quick. Do you ever get scared? Sometimes. But not for me. Well, who for? For you. Why? Because, one day, you're going to have this thing. Bipolar is genetic. I always thought it would be your Uncle Sean that would get it, but, no. I gave it to Stacey. Stacey will give it to you. But I asked Mum and she said... I know what to look for. I know all the signs. I saw them all in Stacey. And I see them all in you. It breaks my heart to say this, Lily... ..but, one day... ..you're going to be just like me. Are you nervous? No. Why would I be nervous? I dunno, some people get nervous when they have their photo taken like this. They sort of stiffen up. I'm not going to be doing anything like that! But, remember, this is about showing people the real East End. Yeah. That's why I asked you, because you grew up around here. I want to see you and I want to see your... What are you doing? What? You said you wanted to see everything. Your personality, not your pecker! I thought this was a naked photo shoot! Who told you that? Rocky and... Oh! I'm going to kill 'em when I get hold of 'em, do you know that? Are you all right? Honey said you left your... It's not what it looks like. I can explain. You can't explain. Look, she said that she wanted to see naked. I didn't. Frankie, shut up! You're making it worse. Your, er... Your lunch is just there. I'm going to... Lola, hang on a minute! Lola, hang on a minute! Lola! Agh. Don't worry. It's just for personal use. Peter. Are you all right? I'm fine. Yeah, you look it. What do you want? Nothing, I was just, er... I heard that you were, er, offering a reward for any information on the person that, er... Anyway, I, um... I wanted to give you some cash towards it. So, er... That's five hundred quid. If no-one comes forward, you can just keep it for yourself. You deserve it. Why are you doing this? Because I'm sorry. What are you sorry for? For what happened to you. I know what it's like to feel scared. Well... ..I think we're at risk of having a moment here, ain't we? So, er... ..I'll head off. Ta. Ta. Lola. Right, so that, there, that was a misunderstanding. That ended up with you in your pants? Yes, right, so let me explain, yeah? So I've agreed to do this photo shoot thing for Frankie, to help the deaf community And how is that helping them? I don't know, right? Anyway, then Rocky and Mitch tell me that it's a naked photo shoot. But it wasn't? Exactly. Look, listen, please don't tell anyone about this, all right? You swear nothing happened? Do you promise me? I... I promise. All right. On two conditions. All right, go on First, you tell Honey the truth, properly. Done. Second - you get rid of them pants. Callum! Here, have you seen this? Is Ben worried? Why would Ben be worried? Because if people find out he's the... I know. I thought Ben would've told you. Yeah, he did, he did tell. I just didn't know about this. I've got to go. Thank you. You'll be OK. You know that don't you? Yeah, I'll be OK. Night-night, angel. Night-night, Nanny Jean. Oh, see, keep your hands up. Mick! Oh! Right, who's ready for the Mick Carter film night? Me! Yeah? Now, a couple of questions. First one, have you seen the film Ratatouille? No. Well, you will have after tonight. There's another question. What is it? Do you like popcorn? Yeah! Good! Because there's three bags upstairs that need to be munched lively. Do you understand? Get up the apples now. Do you know what apples are? Apples and pears - stairs. Get up there now, go on! I'm going to get you! Mick, who's covering the bar? I am. What are you doing here? I just told you - I'm covering the bar. QUIETLY: Where's my money? What money? The 50 grand I gave you to leave Walford. Hm. It doesn't ring a bell. You're making a very big mistake. I don't think so. You don't know what you're dealing with here, Linda. I'll be fine. I WANT my money back. OK. And just out of interest, how exactly are you going to do that? Go to the police? Oh, no, no. I've got a better idea. Why don't you go upstairs and tell Mick you gave the mother of his children 50 grand to leave and never see them again? I'll be down here. You can tell me how it goes. Now, you listen to me... No, you listen to me. I'm staying. For good. Because there is nothing in this world that could make me leave my children. Not 50 grand, not alcoholism and certainly not you. Now... have a lovely evening. "}
{"episode":"m00134j3","subtitles":"This programme contains some strong language. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Mrs Brown's Boys! # She's Mrs Brown Agnes # That's Mrs Brown Agnes # Our Mrs Brown. # Oh, hello. Come in, come in, come in! Well, it's a new year and a new start... CHUCKLES WRYLY I don't know what it is, but I'm feeling very positive about this year. People are just bursting to go. Yeah. There's an excitement in the air. People want to run, drive, fly, well, wherever they want, and who can blame them? I made my New Year's resolution at midnight. Yeah. I got a lift home by a jockey. He said, \"I think I'm a bit small for you. I said, \"No, you're just the right height.\" I... LAUGHTER APPLAUSE My...my... Stop. Stop! My... My New Year's resolution was I gave up alcohol. Longest seven minutes of my bucking life. I got so drunk after it, I threw up at the front door all over the cat. Bleurgh! The cat went, \"Meow...!\" I'm thinking, \"I don't remember bucking eating HIM.\" APPLAUSE AND CHEERING Hello, Winnie, and Happy New Year. Is it but? WINNIE SIGHS What? Is it a happy new year? Here's the mother of sorrows. I mean, everyone's going around saying, \"It's a new year, hurrah,\" but nothing's changed for me, Agnes. Look, Winnie, as the great Greek philo, philo-soffler, erm, Pele...Dumont... Pele said, \"If you want to change, fly over the cuckoo's nest.\" What? Look, it doesn't really translate that well from the Portuguese, but basically what it means is, if you're sitting round thinking about \"Oh, what will I do with me life?\" get up off your arse and do something about it. You're right, Agnes. I need to do something. Exactly. Where would I get a self-help book? Winnie, if I told you that, it would defeat the purpose. CHUCKLES You're right, sorry. Father McBride says I don't do enough around the parish. What does he want you to do? I don't know. I mean, last week alone I blessed the new fire engine at the station AND heard confessions on three different days. Oh, here, you won't believe what I heard about Tina Pippin. What did she tell you? Trevor! You wouldn't want me to break the seal of confession. Of course not. Good. Has she been stealing again? No. She's pregnant. I heard that. No-one knows who the father is. I do. No. Don't tell me. It's not right. You're right. Mum's the word. Joey from the garage? IMITATES WRONG ANSWER BUZZER Good. Anyway, it's private. Even Tina's guaranteed the seal of confession. Absolutely. There was a murder in the flats last night. A man was beaten to death with a fish. Really? Who would do that? They think it was Jack the Kipper. That's a good one! Tommy Kelly's the father. It has to be him. Nope. Gerry Jones. No way! But he's married. I know. # Dun dun-dun, duh duh! # A good start would be to get a new skill. A new skill? Yes. I don't have any old skills. Yes, you do, Winnie. For God's sake, don't be putting yourself down. Well, like what? Well, I've seen you're very agile. I've seen you doing those splits over the candle at the Christmas party. I don't know how you did that. Did you ever find that candle? No. No. And you're good at the, er, the, er... APPLAUSE AND CHEERING It is I, Mother. Good morrow, Mrs McGoogan. Get out of me way, son! I have a life to live! What the hell is going on there? Winnie's woke. So, who are you supposed to be? Seriously? Who'd you think? I don't know. Guess. I don't bucking know. Have a guess. Kim Kardashian. No. Shakespeare. Oh! I'm promoting the Finglas Shakespeare Festival. Starts next week. Ah, hello there, Shakespeare. See? APPLAUSE AND CHEERING How are yous? Oh, good Puck. Language, Mammy! No, no, no. It's Buster. He's Puck. Oh, right. Very nice, Buster. Thanks, Cathy. So, Dermot, what's the motto of the festival this year? Ssss. I hope there's no Ss in it cos you know the way your lisp goes. I don't have a lisp. What? Shades of the Bard. \"Come see Shakespeare's sonnets, soliloquys and serenades \"performed shuperbly in St Saviour'sh, \"Saturday and Sunday.\" APPLAUSE AND LAUGHTER PHONE RINGS I'll get that. Sorry, Trevor. Hey, Trev. Welcome home. Hey, I didn't even hear you come in last night! Yeah. The flight was late getting in. Hello? How do-do-do? Hello, Lilly! How's everybody in Liverpool? So, Buster, do you know any Shakespeare? I do, Cathy. CLEARS THROAT Toby or not Toby. That is the restroom. The weather is no good. Surfing the spring and the Red Arrows to perform. End scene. APPLAUSE AND CHEERING What is it, Mammy? Who was on the phone? Your Aunt Lilly in Liverpool. Lilly the pink? Yes. Uncle Mickey's after getting out of prison. He's on the ferry on his way here. You're kidding me. Oh, no, not Uncle Mickey. Who's Uncle Mickey? I thought he was doing five years for, you know, the scam. We all did. Seriously, who's Uncle Mickey? Who's going to tell Grandad his brother Mickey is out of prison? Who's going to tell him that he's coming HERE? I'll tell him, if someone would tell me who Uncle Mickey is. Have you ever heard of the Railroad Killer? Yeah. Well, it's not him. Oh, right. This is not going to end well. We just want to have a little chat with you, Grandad. I'm dying, aren't I? That's it, I'm dying. No, no. It's not about that, Grandad. Yes, you will die, but not today, unfortunately. Ugh. Mammy, please. It's GOOD news, Grandad. Well, that depends. Mammy, it IS good news. Well, yeah. What is it? Your brother, Mickey, he's out of prison. Yes! That's great news! Oh, I've been praying for that. Really, Grandad - you've been praying? Well, no, not really. Oh, I need to make arrangements to get over to Liverpool and see him. You needn't bother. He's on his way here to Dublin, he'll be here tomorrow. Of course he's coming home. He needs to see his big brother. He needs something, as usual. Every time that man shakes... ..shakes my hand... ..I always feel like he's pumping money out of me purse. You never liked Mickey, and you have this idea that he's a bad egg. Well, Agnes, you're wrong. Well, you know what they say, Grandad. If it walks like a duck and smells like a duck, it's probably Mickey Brown. Yeah. Where you going? I'm going up to get the spare room ready for Mickey. I did not say he could stay here. Mammy, please. Stop. Fine. Get the room ready. Yes! Mammy, I know Uncle Mickey has been difficult in the past. Difficult? Mr Charmer. He's a good for nothing, layabout, lying conman, and the person he's conned most in life is your grandfather. I'll go help Grandad get the room ready. You know, people change, Mammy. Everyone deserves a second chance. I agree. But Mickey Brown is on his tenth second chance. Agnes? APPLAUSE AND CHEERING I've found me thing. Oh, good. Well, when you scratch it, make sure you don't do any damage. Me thing. The thing that's going to help me be the change. What is it? Skydiving. They say it's going to be the thrill of me life. Yeah. Do you know what else they say about skydiving? If at first you don't succeed, no bucking refunds. APPLAUSE Ah, thanks very much, Sharon. Here, I believe Mickey Brown is out of jail, and coming home. So I hear. That's great. I like Mickey. So I hear. Thanks, Sharon. Thanks. All right, Barbara. Here, Mrs Brown, when are Rory and Dino coming back from China? I don't know, love, why? Wash & Blow has been closed all year and I need to do some work. I know. Look, Barbara, leave it with me all right? I'll TickeyTockey the boys tonight and see what's happening. You'll be putting up two of them tomorrow night. Yes. I heard the news. I'm looking forward to seeing your brother. Ah, he's a real gentleman. He's a bastard. I can't believe Uncle Mickey has the cheek to come back here. Last time he conned Grandad out of 500 quid. Grandad says it was an investment. Investment? Yeah, sure it was. Well, all investments carry a risk. Maybe it wasn't HIS fault. That man never took responsibility for anything in his life. Responsibility comes in many forms. Ha. Says the man who ran off to the missions, leaving his brothers with all the problems. What's that supposed to mean? Hey, you two. Don't be getting into that stuff here. What do you mean, THAT stuff? Well... Nothing. Doesn't matter. Well, this stuff has obviously been discussed before, so I'll leave yous to it. AUDIENCE GROANS Seriously, Dermo, who is Uncle Mickey? Shut up, Buster. Kilimanjaro. Who? Not \"who\", Mammy, \"what\". Kilimanjaro is a mountain in Africa. That's right, Cathy, and I'm going to climb it. Pfft! Winnie, you can't climb up the stairs on a bucking bus. True. What's this about? Well, I want to change the trajectory of me life. Well, you pulled that one out of your arse. \"Three tips to change your life.\" Three tips? Yeah. What are they? Well, one, \"be careful not to put yourself \"in a situation where you are disappointed.\" Don't have sex. \"Don't exaggerate problems - \"not everything is as big as you'd expect.\" Oh, that's the fecking truth. Don't have sex. \"And be relaxed. \"Don't be afraid to have a good laugh.\" Well, you won't get a better laugh than having sex. Who wrote that shite?! You did. LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE Who wrote that shite?! I did. It's Cathy's self-help book. Oh, it's very good advice. How is the book selling, Cathy? All right. AGNES CHUCKLES It's a very narrow market. Oh, very narrow, yeah. Just Winnie. Winnie, all you need to do is build up your self-confidence. Yeah. You might not climb Kilimanjaro but you need to feel like you could do if you wanted to. Exactly. You see, mine is an old-fashioned marriage. What did you do, jump over the broom? Oh. Jacko is the type of man that believes a woman's place is in the kitchen. Well, any man who thinks that should remember where the bucking knives are kept. Cathy, do you have my Credit Union book? Yeah. I must get it off you. You've never asked for it. Why now? I'd like to look and see how I'm doing. It's not a crime, is it? No. Right, I'll leave it out for you. Thank you. I've been with the Credit Union ten years now. They're great. They are. I remember the day I joined. I think Buster Brady was the head of the queue. You think? Well, it was somebody wearing a balaclava. ALL: It was Buster! Ah, Grandad, it's good to see you up and in good form. Look, I'm sorry if I upset you last night. You! Mickey Brown! Hello, Agnes. Long time, no see. Not long enough. You're looking great. I'm just getting a cup of tea for my brother. Will I get you a cup? No, thank you. I'll make my own tea. Gotta look after my brother. Ugh! Ugh. What's that smell? Oh, yes, I know it. It's a rat. Hiya, Agnes. Great news. Yeah, yeah. Hiya, Winnie. I have it. There's a fella down the shops says he works in the zoo, said he can arrange for me to put me head in a tiger's mouth. Yeah, that's nice. So I thought about it and thought, \"Feck it, I'm going to do it.\" Yeah, that's nice. Right, so see you later. Yeah, bye, bye, bye, bye. Now, where was I? Oh, yes. It's a gold mine in South Africa. Now, NOBODY knows about this, so the deal I've got is I put in 5,000, and in two months I get back a million. THUD! Wow! That's a great deal. I wouldn't mind a slice of that. Ooh, I don't know if it's too late already. But I could check if you'd like? Yeah. Hiya, Mammy. Hiya, Cathy. You on your own? Just me and Win... Where's Winnie? Oh, that's right, Winnie's gone to the zoo. Winnie's gone to the fecking zoo! Winnie! Winnie! Damien, this is my Uncle Mickey. Hello. Hello, Father. Delighted to meet you. You two catching up? Yeah. It's great. Yes, it is. What's up? Please don't get annoyed, Trevor, but shaking hands with your uncle? I feel like I just shook hands with the devil. Don't be judgmental. No, of course not. Now, you have to promise me you'll stay calm. I will. Father Damien... AUDIENCE: Ooh... I thought you said you needed us to come over, that it was an emergency? Well, in many ways it is. Sit down and let's talk. I'm supposed to play for the darts team in Foley's. I'd better ring and cancel. What's Foley's number? 08081 570000. Well done, Buster. I done a memory course. When? I forget. Sit down. Sorry, lads, but I have to call. RINGING TONE I'm their best player, and most popular. Hello, Sharon? The was Dermot Brown. He won't be coming. CHEERING Now, Trevor, you have something you want to say to Mark? Mark. I'm sorry. I never gave any thought that I was leaving you to keep the family going. Dermo, you'll be next. You've been a wonderful big brother to all of us, and I owe you so much. And Dermo... Buster, stop. He'll get to me in a minute. I don't know how to explain it. I felt the call to serve the Lord and I just went. Dermo, you're gonna be next. Shush, Buster! Give him a chance! You're right. It was selfish of me and, again, I'm so sorry. Thanks, Trevor, I appreciate the apology but the truth be told, had you stayed here, I would've went to England. I never would have met Betty. She's been the best thing that's ever happened to me. AUDIENCE: Aw! Well, that was just beautiful. Come here. Can I buy you both a pint? Yeah, sure. Dermo... What? If it wasn't for you, your mammy wouldn't be able to run this family. They didn't say it... ..but they know it. Do you want tea? Do you want a hug? AUDIENCE: Aw. APPLAUSE Come on, I might still make the darts match. No, Dermo, take your time. The team want a chance to win just at least once. Now, you're tired. We can talk about all of this tomorrow. Off to bed. SIGHS Goodnight, now, Agnes. What's this? What's what? That seems like a nice juicy envelope. What's that for? That's for you, if you play your cards right. Really? What do I have to do? Go. Now. Tonight. I'll tell Grandad tomorrow you had some emergency. But you go and don't come back, and that's yours. I need... 5,000 euro, I know. So, deal or no deal? I'll miss the old bastard. No, you won't. You're right, I won't. So? Deal. I'll just go get my things. See you later, alligator. BOOING Oh, for feck's sake. How are you, Agnes? Hi, Winnie. You want tea? Ah, no, thanks, love. Oh, that was a close thing with that tiger today. I can still see those stripes and I shudder. OK. Winnie, it was not a close thing today, and the reason it wasn't a close thing today is because that was not a tiger, it was a zebra. And your head wouldn't fit in his mouth. You know, from Kilimanjaro to skydiving, to.... I don't care what you say, that was a tiger. You have been against everything I've suggested I do to change me life. Because I don't want you to change. I think you're fine just the way you are. Well, I don't have to change if I don't want to. No, you don't. But I could do all of those things if I wanted to. Yes, you could. Well, I'll see you tomorrow. I'll see YOU tomorrow. I love you. I love YOU. Goodnight. Goodnight! APPLAUSE Well, that was a busy day. Just looking back at the year, you know. Captain Kirk went to space. Yeah, in the big dildo. Up and down in ten minutes. My husband could do that. And see that Star Trek, when they go, \"Boldly go where no man has been before\"? And then when they get there, there's somebody there. Never got that. KNOCK AT DOOR It's open, Barbara, come on. How are ye, Mrs Brown? How are ye, Barbara? Thanks for coming over. Barbara, I've good news and bad news. Oh? Go on. Rory and Dino will not be coming back from China soon. They've decided to adopt. Oh, my God! A boy or a girl? A Vietnamese pig. So, that's the good news? That's the bad news. The good news is they want you to run the salon. You're the boss, Barbara. APPLAUSE AND CHEERING That's fantastic! Yes, it is. I've so many ideas! Right, you can email them. Like changing the colour scheme to yellow. Yeah, oh, love to, yeah. But not yellow-yellow, kind of mixed daffodil and sunrise yellow. The towels could be yellow. Oh, yeah. And the chairs could be yellow. Yeah. And the curtains could be yellow. And you could buck off. Her family colour must be yellow. Oh, hello, Grandad. Uh... Mickey's not in his room. I know. He said he had some kind of emergency. He had to slip away. Hmm. Probably something to do with his gold mine in South Africa. Probably. Hmm. You see? You WERE wrong. He never took a penny off me. Nothing. People change, you know. I know. I think I'm owed an apology. I-I... Uh-h-h-h... I'm sorry. I hope you apologised to him too. I did, yeah. Look, Grandad, go in and sit down and make yourself comfortable. I'll bring you in a cup of tea. Good, good. All right, Grandad? Oh, yes. Hiya, Mammy. Oh, Trevor, good man. Hello, Father Damien. Trevor, bring that in to your grandad. Oh, and his biscuits. Here, I'll take them. Oh, thank you, Father Damien. Hey, Ma. Hello, son. Just on me way to work, dropped in to see you're OK. I'm fine. Uncle Mickey left last night. Yeah, I know. Terrible what happened to him. Why, what happened? On his way to the airport, he was mugged. No! Yeah. You have to be careful out there. Oh, my God. Right, Buster, let's go. Oh, and, er... Here you go. APPLAUSE AND CHEERING What's this? I don't know, but it has your name on it. I'll see you. 5,000 euro. \"Less 10% finder's fee to Buster Brady.\" Trevor, did YOU know about this? Damien, you wouldn't want me to break the seal of confession, would you? See you, Mammy. I'll see you, son. Well... Well, well. It all works out the way it's supposed to. It always does. Brothers, huh? You know, every boy and every man that has a brother will admit that they don't tell each other often enough how much they love each other. Oh, my boys are easy-going at the best of times, but see if something threatens their sister, Cathy, or their sprightly and oddly attractive mother, they're like wolves. I'm glad that Mark and Trevor have made up, and, you know, Buster and Dermot was a prime example that you don't have to be from the same mother to be brothers. You just have to be in prison. You know, I suppose, in a way, that's what me and Winnie are. Brothers. Brothers in arms. God, somebody should make a song out of that. Goodnight. # Say hello to the queen of Dublin town # As the best mum of all She wears the crown # Mother hen watching all her chicks # Sassy old lady full of tricks # It's a safe bet she'll never let life get her down # She's Mrs Brown Agnes... # Goodnight! # That's Mrs Brown # Our Mrs Brown. # "}
{"episode":"p09zfh72","subtitles":"MUSIC PLAYS INSIDE He's back again. MUSIC PLAYS LOUDLY GRUNTING You embarrassed my boy Spider in public. That can't run. But I ain't unjust. Going forward, you turn a blind eye, you get paid. No, thanks. You got bare nerve. You know what? I could use you. Yo, you want a job? No, thank you. Very polite. Bet you don't speak with your mouth full, either. All right! I'll turn a blind eye. But I don't want your money. HE COUGHS KNOCK ON DOOR Christian Taylor? I'm not talking to you without a solicitor. You're not under suspicion. You're just helping us with our inquiries. I'm not helping you with anything and I want my one phone call. You're not under arrest. Do you know who Christian really is? Do we ever truly know who someone really is? Some days, I'm not sure I even know who I really am. This is Christian Taylor. He's the impostor. No, the man you know as Christian Taylor is the impostor. Who's this guy? The real Christian Taylor. And what's the question? Do you know who he is? No, I've never seen him before. No, not... Not him. Do you know who the impostor is? Well, you said his name was Christian Taylor. Are you screwing with us? Sergeant, why would I do that? I don't know which one is Christian, which one is the impostor. I do know that one of them owes me \u00a34 for a sandwich, so do make sure you get that back when you catch him. His name's not really Christian? That makes a lot of sense, actually, because I called over to him one time, I said, \"Oh, can you pass me that bin bag, Christian?\" And he didn't even look round. Although he was wearing headphones cos he was using a hedge trimmer, so that might have had something to do with it. Is that useful? Probably won't stand up in court, will it? Defence'll tear it to shreds. Unless I'm the prosecution. Sorry, there's no place for humour in a police interrogation. Do you know his real name? No. You never seen him outside community service? No. You wouldn't consider him a friend? No. Rani has no love for Christian. She snitched on him twice. What I'm about to tell you, it can't leave this room, OK? Diane, the gun you found was used in a shooting. Gaaash! I mean, yes, I am glad I found the gun and can help solve such a terrible crime. Your father's van was identified at the scene of a drug robbery in which a masked figure was seen holding a gun, a gun that bears a striking resemblance to the one you claim you saw Christian hiding. How do you account for that? I don't know - a coincidence? Quite a big coincidence, wouldn't you say? Statistically, coincidences are more common than you think. Is that so? In 2009, the Bulgarian lottery announced the same six winning numbers on two consecutive draws. People thought was a fix, the government investigated, but no tampering was found. It was just a coincidence. Do you know it's a crime to lie to the police? It's not a lie. Just Google \"Bulgarian lottery\". This is the man who was shot. Tell me if you recognise him. Whoa! Is that tattoo permanent? I believe so, yes. What if he has to go for a job interview or something? He's not going for job interviews. Yeah, well, not with that on his face. He is seriously limiting his career options. I mean, teaching's out. Vicar? It's imperative we find the man who's impersonating Christian. Leave it to me. He doesn't mean you go and find him. I don't mind. I'm happy to help. Diane, Mr Wild is right. But I would like it if you'd help me build an E-FIT of the impostor. Yeah, no probs. I've got his face up here. Clear as day. Good. SHE EXHALES If Christian makes contact with you, call me. If you hear from Christian, give me a ring. Christian calls you, call me. If you hear from Christian, please contact me. You hear from Christian, contact me ASAP. I want to know what you're up to - before I tell Diane you were sneaking around in her office. If you were going to do that, you'd have done it already. We're meeting at the placement at 4:00, then we're going to look for Christian. Can you make it? That kid had a fake name and a gun. Are you out of your bloody mind? I'll take that as a maybe. Sir, permission to speak freely? Don't have to ask permission. You know it's a longstanding dream of mine to be a police detective, but my criminal record, of which I am not proud, inhibits that dream. In a continuing effort to build valuable credit to help support any future application to the police, I would like your consent to take the minibus and seek out the impostor who has been posing as Christian Taylor. Sorry, I drifted off halfway through that. What are you asking? To take the minibus to look for Christian. Absolutely not. But, sir... Diane, you are never going to be a police detective. Why don't you just stick to the work you're actually paid for? Who knows, in five, ten years' time you could be doing my job. No offence, sir... ..but I don't want to end up like you. I want to actually do something with my life. Go home. Before for one of us says something both of us might regret. ALARM CHIRPS You know this person? Seen him around. Any idea why he's lying in a hospital bed? Is he finally getting that stupid tattoo removed? You're currently doing community service for failures to appear in court. Is that right? Yeah. And I really feel like I'm giving something back to the community. Can we cut the shit? Who are you paying to do your hours? I don't know what you mean. Who are you sending in your place? What? How would I expect to get away with that? I'd have to believe you white people in law enforcement think all black people look the same. What kind of cynical bastard would I be to think police in this country are racist, huh? I know who you are. I know you ran the Brook Hill crew. And I'm coming for you, do you understand? Go. How'd you get into this, then? Bit of a computer nerd? I ask cos I'm looking to join the force myself. I mean, not as a desk jockey, like you. Want to actually make a difference. No offence. Yeah, OK, let me try that. Mm, eyes a bit closer together. How's it going? Oh, hello, ma'am. Yeah, good, good. This is looking pretty close, yeah. I mean, I would say his lips and his chin are a little bit more like Aston's from JLS. JLS? You don't know who JLS are? Runners-up from X Factor series five. Do you not watch X Factor? What do you watch, Strictly? I mean, Aston was on Strictly, too, actually. He lost the dance off to Mollie King from The Saturdays. It wasn't Aston's fault, it was his partners. I mean, why would you do a Viennese waltz when it's '70s Disco Week? Don't know. Yeah, I didn't know. Exactly. Oh, yeah. Spot on, that is. Great. Brilliant. Can we just get this sent out to all divisions ASAP? ASAP. Thanks. Well done, Diane. Oh, thank you, ma'am. DOOR CLOSES Sit down, Frank. You've done a lot of mean and selfish things over the years, and when you came back into our lives, you promised you'd change, make amends. If I haven't been nice to you it's cos I've had no faith in you. But you've proved me wrong. So I apologise. And when your ankle tag comes off, Tom and Holly and me, we'd like you to stay here with us permanently. I'd like that. I love you, Dad. Come and give Grandpa a hug. Come on, Tom. Greg Fried Rice! Working weekends? Yeah, just catching up on some stuff. Do you know what I've been thinking? We share a desk, right? We've never shared a beer. We should get a drink sometime. OK. How about six o'clock? Today? Yeah, they do a great ploughman's at the Bull. Do you like ploughman's? I love ploughman's. I always ask for cheese...and ham. Bit cheeky, isn't it? I got plans. Oh, cancel them. I can't cancel them. Cancel them. I want to have a beer and a ploughman's. And you should invite Howard Cherry. What? See you at six, mate. Oh, and I hope you don't mind - I gave your cupboard a little spring clean. Wouldn't like the partners to see the mess it's in. Hello, Dad. Wasn't expecting you to be here. Everything OK? Where did the money come from? You know where the money came from. You met Mr Cherry. I called your lawyers. They've never heard of any Howard Cherry. Well, that-that makes no sense. Don't lie to me! I can still beat the tar out of you. I'm not lying. I know he's a fraud! I saw you picking up rubbish with him, for God's sake! Now, where did the money come from? We found it. Stop lying! I'm not lying! Dad, some gang kid hid a bag of money and we found it. I built this company with honour. Never stole, never cheated. First sign of trouble, you take dirty money. I'm not surprised. You always were lazy...and weak! Lazy and weak? Yes! I gave you all this on a plate, and you ran it into the ground! I didn't run anything into the ground, Dad! You pissed my company down the drain! OUR company! And I didn't piss anything, OK? I'm saving it! How, with stolen money? And what happens when the man you took it from comes looking for it, huh? Well, he won't. He can't, because the police are going to catch him. They're going to put him in prison and he's going to be out of our hair. That's your plan? Pray the cops get him? You're taking the easy route again. Same way you put us here. I'm not praying anything. Dad, listen, I'll find him myself and I'll hand him to the authorities, OK? I'll sort this! Dad! I will sort this! Mum? I'm just going to the library, OK? Actually, Mum, that was a lie. I'm not going to go to the library, I'm going to go...look to that boy. Oh, no, Rani. Mum, please. Do you have feelings for this boy? I don't know, maybe. You don't think I understand how you feel, but I do. I don't think you do. I do, I do. Just sit, sit down one moment. I have to go. Please just come sit down one minute. Come. Sit. When your father and I were first married, I got a job at a company that imported clothes. I used to do sketches back then so that maybe one day I could be a fashion designer. So I showed some of my drawings to the man who ran the company, and he said he loved them. He encouraged me. He said he wanted to make them. So we worked on them together in the evenings, and he started making overtures. He said that he wanted me to leave your father for him and... ..I considered it. You considered it? Your father was struggling. He was working all hours. We barely saw each other. This other man, he was so handsome and wealthy and supportive. What happened? I turned him down. Then I left the company because... ..I couldn't stand to be around him every day. So, you see, I do understand how you feel, your attraction to this boy. But if I hadn't made the right choice by staying with your father, by honouring my obligations, then you wouldn't be here. Do you think about him? About... About what your life might've been? Doesn't matter what might have been. Only what is right. Rani, I had a duty to this family back then. Just like you have a duty to this family now. Thank you for sharing that... with me. But... ..that was your choice. It's not mine. You are not leaving this house! Mum! No! Please, this is important! No! THEY SHOUT What is going on here?! She's going to be with that boy! No! What? Mum, please, this is important! You promised us there would be no more of this. There's no time! You have exams that you should be studying for! Go to your room! No. Do what your father says! Go to your room now! Fuck! How much longer do we wait? I have a 7:00pm curfew. And I don't want to be down here after dark. Why? The people that live round here working class, not vampires. I'm just saying, the police are looking for him, too. So we need to move quick and we need to try and blend in. Yo, homies. Great. She should blend in perfectly. If we wind up at a bullfight. Hi, darling. Oh, yay. John came, too. What are you doing here? Help you find the kid. Oh, so all of a sudden you care about Christian? He's here, isn't he? His sort don't suddenly change. My sort. Why, though? Because... Because you were right. You can't let the police hunt him down like a rabid dog. PHONE RINGS Where are you? Everyone's here. Under house arrest. I need your help. Hey, take a look at this. Does it seems to you that the driver of the van and the masked man with the gun have any connection? Seems like the van's just driving by. But assume for a moment that there is a connection. Is it conceivable that the masked man is gesturing to the driver? What do you mean? \"Go, go, go, get out of here, drive!\" Come with me. Got it. OK. Rani has hit a snag. She's messaged Christian to tell him to meet us here, if he can. So, Frank, you stay here just in case he turns up. Should have brought something to read. Here, read that. Now, everyone else follow me. Come on, chop chop. DOORBELL RINGS Yes? My name's Myrna. Would you like to end racism? How long will it take? Shouldn't take long. In 1980, I founded the Bristol Justice Collective, and ever since I've been fighting for equality and respect for people of colour. Are you willing to join me in driving a stake through the beating heart of racism? My husband tends to deal with things like that. Is your husband at home? There's a woman here who wants to drive a stake through the beating heart of racism. Whatever you're selling, we are not interested. You are not interested in ending racism? Well, yes, obviously. Do you have children? One daughter. They say money can't buy happiness, but what if I said a \u00a330 a month donation could buy your daughter a happier future? We don't need to buy our daughter a happier future. You see, she's got a full scholarship to Oxford University. We'll have a think about it. When someone says they'll have a think about it, it usually means, A, they're not interested or, B, they are interested, but they're not sure. Which is it? A. Bye-bye. You want to know something funny? Mm-hm. I think today is my birthday. Oh, Ez, I'm sorry. No, no, no, no. What are you apologising for? All I ever wanted for my sweet 16th was tinned sweetcorn and a smell of stagnant piss. 16. I got no hold on you now. Treating you. Maybe tomorrow. You know, I'm going to give this Airbnb a very negative review. We've stayed in worse. And I won't rent to nurses, they'll put five in a room because they're cleaning up after other people all day, they make no effort when they get home, happy to live in their own shit, nurses. I mean, don't get me wrong, they're saints. God bless the NHS. But THIS is the place. Can you feel the potential? It's a shell. With potential. Is this supposed to be a kitchen? That'll clean up, bit of elbow grease, don't worry about that. There's no fridge. Yes, there is. My bad. There's no washing machine, no cooker. You've got everything you need across the street. Launderette, kebab shop, bookies, vape store, hey, another kebab shop. See, this is an up and coming area. How much? 585 per calendar month. My brother can't afford that if he's going to keep me in kebabs and vapes. 585 for this place? Nah, you've got to be kidding me. You've got no references, no savings, a bad credit score and a very low income. Could be worse, he could be a nurse. I don't have the money. Well... ..can you get it? You like these? I got them from a guy named Barney. Only problem was - man had four fingers. You know what I'm saying? So when he was handing the box over, I was like... It was mad, I was trying to not look at him, you know what I'm saying? Can we have a word? Say what you got to say here, big bro. Look, I need some Ps. LAUGHTER He's broke! I think I offered you a job and you said no. You think if you did that to Lord Sugar he'd still make you his apprentice? Yeah, well, circumstances have changed. Not mine. Do you have a job for me or not? Who the fuck do you think you're talking to? You think because we went to the same school, you don't have to show me no fucking respect. Fuck you, pussyhole. Look, I'm sorry. All right? Spider, look, I'm sorry for dissing you at the club. LAUGHTER You know me. You know I can be useful. I think I want to see you beg. Come on, bro. \"Come on, bro,\" what? You gave up your shit minute you came over here. If you want my Ps... ..get on your knees and kiss my creps. And I want to see tongue on tongue. You never hear him? Hurry up, then. He's actually going to do it. LAUGHTER Yes. An old pipe? You shouldn't have(!) I've got a plan. I'll come with you. Nah, nah, you can't help me with this. You wait here. It won't be long. Wait, wait. I'm sorry. I'll be back as soon as I can. All right? KNOCKING ON DOOR Hi, this is going to seem like a strange question, but do you know this person? Who's asking? We're friends of his from community service. We thought his name was Christian Taylor, but we saw his file and Christian Taylor's you, isn't it? Look, OK, I know you don't know us and we're not here to cause any trouble, but we just really need to find... I'm not sure what to call him. Ben. Ben. OK. Is Ben a friend of yours? Yeah, he's my best friend. And he's been doing your hours for you? You can trust us, really. My dad needs care around the clock. Ben volunteered to do my hours for me so I could look after him. Oh, my God, that is so sweet! Yeah, Ben's a great guy. Well, you know that. What do you want with Benny? He's in trouble, and it's my fault. We just want to help him. Do you have any idea where we could find him? I wish. I've been trying to find him myself. Well, here's my number. If you hear from him, would you give me a call? We just really need to get hold of him. Yeah, me too. OK, thank you. They say that money can't buy happiness but did you know that for a \u00a330 a month donation you could be helping to end racism? Come on. I'll just... I'll just leave this leaflet. Christian? Ben? It's me, it's Rani. OK, start knocking on doors. Yeah. Not that one, we've done that one. So he's not there. We're going to need to split up and ask around. OK? No, sorry. OK, thank you. No, sorry. Thanks. OK, thank you. Are you Lady Gabby? No, no, I can't say he looks familiar at all, no. I was wondering if you've seen this handsome young man? Rude. Sorry, sorry! Oh, cheers for that. Thank you. Yeah, I know him, he's a great lad, he looks after his little sister. But you don't know where he is? I haven't seen him for a few days now. Yeah. Sorry. OK, thank you. HE EXHALES Thanks, mate. Well, where's your men's room? Toilets for customers only. Fine, double mai tai. What the fuck's a mai tai? Do you have a pineapple? Hello. May I join you? Get a drink first. Three mai tais. I'm looking for... Oh, yeah, he's a sweet boy, really polite. Is he OK? He's, um... Yeah, I don't know. He lives local. And the question is whether you've seen him or not. No, I haven't. I'm sorry. OK. There's a laptop in there! All right. Fun's over. You're acting like children. Anything? No. No. Nothing. Anything? Greg, how are you, mate?! I don't know who you are. I've never met you before. I'm Jeff. I work here. I've not seen you for a while. Yeah, you've never seen me. I've never been here or anywhere... Just be quiet. I sold you that DVD, Indiana Bones and the Temple of Poon. No-one buys DVDs, do they? Because it's a dead technology, so you're mistaken. Hey, wait, do you remember that porn star name game that we played? What was Christian's? How is that relevant? Your porn name is your first pet and the street you grew up on. Maybe someone there knows him. No, Christian didn't have a pet. Oh, wait, but his neighbour did. And it was... Fluffy...Lambs Bottom. Fluffy Lambs Bottom. That way. # Don't cha wish your girlfriend was raw like me? # Don't cha wish your girlfriend was fun like me? # Don't cha? # Don't cha? # Inside now. Move, move. Remember me. I ain't got no money, man. I don't want your money, I want information. The people who were here before, who are they? Just, uh, just friends of mine. You're chatting shit. They were serving up in here. Who are they? No, man, friends of mine from London, I've known them for ages, I swear. Do you want to lose your life for these friends of yours? No. Who are they? I didn't get no names. Who do they work for? I don't know. Who the fuck do they work for? They only referred to him as The Dean, but he don't leave London. He pays a local crew for protection. What local crew? Have you heard of Brook Hill? Hello, sir. My name's Diane Pemberley, I'm from Bristol Community Service. Do you know this man? Yes. Aston from JLS. Ah, no, I see your confusion. I thought the...same. DOORBELL RINGS We are not interested in ending racism! Hello again, Mrs Rekowski. Why didn't you tell me your daughter was doing community payback? It is not something we are proud of. Is Rani here? I need to speak with her. Rani? Rani, the police are here. They want to talk to you. Rani! Oh, God. Oh, God! MOBILE PHONE RINGS Voicemail. Hello, Rani. The police are here. We're not angry with you but please can you call us? OK, sweetheart? Please call. Where is she? Mr Rekowski, it wasn't you at the drug house robbery, was it? It was Rani. You lied to me. Yes. If you know where Rani is, you have to tell me. We don't know. This is serious. If your daughter is involved with this boy, she's in real danger. Well, if I knew where she was, I would tell you. I know how we can find her. Right at the bottom. THEY CHATTER INAUDIBLY DOORBELL RINGS No, no. Don't recognise him? No. Thanks for your help. KNOCK ON DOOR Hello. Sorry to bother you. My name is John. No, no, no. No, no, don't, because I'm...I am with the Church... of Our Lady of Perpetual Help, and we run a community outreach programme for kids with difficult backgrounds. This...this young man came to us for help and has since gone missing. We are very concerned for his whereabouts. Have you seen him? Yeah, I've seen him sometimes, coming and going from a house up the street. Oh, thank Christ...Jesus Christ. Thank Jesus Christ, our Lord and Saviour. Which number? Marky? That you? Who are you? We're looking for Ben. You police? No, we're friends of his, do you know him? Got to go, waiting for someone. We're just going to ask a few questions. Please. Thank you. What do you want? We need to find, Ben. It's really important. So if you know where he is... Please, I'm rattling. Or if you've seen him. Someone coming, I've got to go. KNOCK ON DOOR Marky, it's all right, they're not the police. Marky, they're not the police. I swear to you, I swear. Here you go. If you have any idea where we can find him, that would help us. I can't help you. Gimme that! Where is he? I don't know. Give it me! Tell me where he is and you can have this! I don't know, my son don't talk to me! Please give it to me. Just give it to her. Where is he? His flat, probably. Where would he go if he couldn't go there? I don't know! Think! The burnt warehouse with the graffiti, Cumberland Basin. Him and his sister used to run away when they was kids. I used to find them there. Please! For God's sake. Thank you. Sorry. You're not going to hurt my boy, are you? No. You're not going to hurt my son? No. He looks after me, looks after his sister. He's a good boy. Yeah, I used to... What chance do you have when your mother is that ill, hey? No chance. RINGTONE PLAYS STEEL DRUM MUSIC Hello. Greg-nog, where are you? Ploughman's arrived. Yeah, I'm running a bit late, actually. What is this about, exactly? It's about the fact that if you're not here in the next half hour, I'll contact the Solicitor's Regulation Authority and you'll never practise law again. And then I'll eat your pickled onion. Soldier, did you find the prick? This is the prick. You got bare nerve. I've got bare nerve? You set me up. What you chatting about? I know about The Dean. You made me steal his line to keep yourself, knowing you could blame me for it when he clocked. Yeah, fine, you're right. But why did you have to take his fucking money too? Why did you double cross him? Listen, I had no choice. He's running lines all over the West that should be mine and taxing me too! Then there was COVID, no furlough scheme for me. And I've got to feed, clothe and house two brothers, one sister and a mum who can't work because she's got to take full time care of my dad. I don't earn, they don't eat. Just return the fucking money, brother. But the money's gone. Get it back then! I can't get it back. Then I've got to hand you to The Dean, bruv. No, no, no, no. Look, just let me and Ez leave Bristol. All right? Once we go we're out of your hair. All right? You won't have to see us again. Not going to happen, bruv. The Dean wants a body and it ain't going to be mine, so you can run all you like but I will find you. Hey. No, no, no, it's OK. You OK? What are you doing here? We came to help. I was just coming. Feds? No. Why are you here? Because I'm your friend. Friends don't snitch on each other. You had a gun. I was scared. I'm...I'm sorry. I didn't know what to do. You could have trusted me! What, like, you trusted me...Ben? No, you didn't come here to help. Then, why am I here? The same reason you're a shoplifter, to piss off Mum and Dad, to feel alive, whatever meaning of life bullshit you're in the middle of. Look around, Rani. Some of us don't have to fuck things up on purpose. Life fucks things up just fine on its own. Go home. You don't have to trust me, but there are four strangers in there with nothing to gain who came here to help you. So why don't you let them? I've lost her. What do you mean you've lost her? She might have gone into a building or underground. Underg...? What, did she fall down a hole?! The only real evidence against you is Rani saying that she witnessed you hiding the firearm. Now, I would never advocate perjury, but if she proved to be an unreliable witness, that would help your case enormously. And it's not like the gun was fired. What? The gun was fired. I shot someone. Oh, my God. It was self-defence. Is the person...? I don't know. OK, you have to hand yourself in, running makes you look guilty. If you wait for the police to catch up with you it will weaken your case and they will catch up with you. We won't abandon you, I promise. Look, if you need help with money, I can always get you a lawyer like Greg. Or a competent one. You'll have the support of my group. I barely trust you lot, you think I'm going to trust police or lawyers? Look, I appreciate you guys coming back. I think I'm going to take my chances. Son, I understand what you're saying. I remember the 1970s. The police were always roughing up black people, thinking they could arrest us any which way they wanted. One day, me and my mates found this young black boy lying in the road, covered in blood. He said the police had beaten him up. So we carried him to the police station, told them what happened, and they told us to fuck off. Called us black bitches, niggers, coons, disgusting language. I was young, white hot with rage, so I went and bought some petrol. Stole some empty milk bottles, ripped up a silk scarf my mum had given me to use as a wick, and I went back to that police station at night when it was empty, and I lit those petrol bombs and I sent them in front and back and burned that place to the ground. I felt like a hero, like some sort of warrior fighting for justice. The next day, in the paper, said the police station wasn't empty. PC Colin Denison, 28 years old, died in that fire. Why are you telling me this? Because take it from me, if you don't face up to the consequences of your actions, the guilt won't go away. 34 years' time, it'll still be there, growing inside you like a tumour. Ha! Argh! Oh! Sorry, you all right? Oh, oh, that's probably going to be a black eye. Ah, and I've got a date tomorrow. You've got a date?! Yeah, why is that shocking? You! You are in big trouble. Who's this? Don't matter. It does matter! I'm your worst nightmare! Hello, sweetie, you all right? I'm Diane. Nice to meet you. How did you meet this date? My mum fixed us up, and he's an absolute stud, apparently. How did you know where to find us? Doesn't matter. It was you, wasn't it? It was fucking you! Look, you're in major trouble ,matey, all of you are for aiding and abetting. And you have royally screwed yourself, missy! Shh! Shh! Don't tell me to shush! Shut up, man. SHE SCOFFS Can you believe him? I am your superior, actually! Everyone, get to the minibus now. No, you don't get to give the orders, I give the orders if anyone is giving orders... Go! Run! OK, all right. You heard him. Go, everyone! That is an order from me! That way. SHE SCREAMS I've got you! Drive! Drive! Go faster! Thank you. Her signal's back, but she is moving very fast. What is going on?! I don't know. Fuck! Oh, are you OK? Are you all right? Listen, it's best if you come quietly, I know you shot someone. No, he didn't. I did. Ez! Look, she's lying. No, I'm not. Take me to the police. Diane, look, ignore her. OK? She's just a kid. Don't let him take the blame for something I did. Look, listen to me, I have nothing to lose. You do. This is my fault. You're smart. Ask Rani. You've got a bright future. I won't let you ruin that. Look, they already think it's me. I can't do this to you. It's going to be OK, I promise you. SINGING: Don't cha wish your girlfriend was hot like me? Here you are! What happened to you guys? I was worried... All right, everyone, facedown on the ground! OK? I said get on the fucking ground! All right. All right. Facedown! No-one look at me or I'll cut you! RINGTONE PLAYS STEEL DRUM MUSIC That's my phone. Shall I answer it? No. Just it's this bloke from work and he'll kill me if I don't. Yeah? What do you think I'll do? I'll let it go to voicemail. You two, up. London don't need Ez. It's going to be OK, all right? Come on, then. Move! Son... ..I don't know what circumstances in your life have led to this moment, but no-one here has any right to judge you. We're all here because we made a lot of bad decisions. But I am telling you right now that the only way this ends... ..is with him staying and you walking out that door. Move! POLICE SIRENS WAIL IN DISTANCE Oh, my God. We need to get our story straight for the police. Stay here. HANDCUFFS TIGHTEN Hey, it's OK. It's OK. While carrying out my duties as a community payback supervisor, I found a CZ 75 semi-automatic pistol. Someone who looked like this Christian or Ben, whatever his name is, stuck a gun in my face. You told me you'd never seen Benjamin Eastfield outside of community service. Would you like to change that statement? No. What about now? I saw them together at this boat party and they were laughing, dancing, flirting, it was very intimate. When pressed, Rani Rekowski told me she saw the pistol being handled by Christian Taylor, real name, Ben something. I made that up. Why would you do that? To get back at him. Get back at him why? She told me that she told Christian, Ben, that she has feelings for him, but he didn't have the same feelings for her. I mean, and if I'm honest, I think he has a bit of a thing for me. So you lied to Diane about seeing him with the gun as revenge? I was really jealous and upset. Women are so emotional. Well, you know that. Is the man, who was shot, dead? No, he's awake and doing OK. Did he identify the shooter? Won't tell us anything. That's because snitches get stitches. You might want to write that down. Was this the man that threatened you with the gun? Listen, all I know is black kids are nine times more likely to be stopped by the police than white kids. So what does that tell you? Did you know that John is being sued for aggravated racial assault? I mean, the man's a monster! You have no fingerprints on the gun, and your only witnesses are a jilted lover and a confirmed racist. Are you really going to charge my client? If the gun wasn't yours, then why run? Why not go to the police? Do you want to answer that or should I? We've been out looking for the impostor Christian, whose real name is Ben but we didn't know his name was Ben until we found Christian. Christian said he was friends with Ben, the person we thought was Christian. But Christian was an impostor too, pretending to be friends with Christian, meaning Ben, to use us to find Ben, who we thought was Christian. Is that helpful? Get out. Thank you. Diane, as one member of law enforcement to another, how do I prove this man fired this gun? Ma'am, as I see it, you can't prove a thing. You want to be a police officer. If you were in my shoes, would you just let him walk away scot free? No, ma'am. I'd want to see him punished. How would you do that? 100 hours of community payback. # Don't you know that's the sound of the men? # They're working on the chain gang # Oh ah, the sound of the men # They're working on the chain gang # All day long they're singing # Mm hoh uh ah # Mm ah... # I think we're going to need a bit more cooperation... # Don't you know the sound of the men? # They're working on the chain gang # Can't you hear them working? # They're working on the chain gang # All day long they work so hard # Till the sun is going down... # Diane, look at this rat I found.

Thanks to Kenneth Lim and Vihaan Ramamurthy for their help with that touching video tribute. This year has been nothing short of... BLEEP is crazy. It's insane. Jason. What? No swearing. It's the last day of school. We're good. Historic. Over five years ago, half of all life in the universe, including our own Midtown High, was wiped from existence. Then eight months ago, a band of brave heroes brought us back. TUBA BLARES AND STUDENTS SCREAM They called it \"The Blip.\" Those of us who Blipped away came back the same age... But our classmates that didn't Blip had grown five years older. My little brother is now older than me. Yeah, it's math. Even though we had Blipped away halfway through the school year and had already taken midterms, the school made us start the whole year over from the beginning. It's totally unfair. It's not right. Tigers, it's been a long, dramatic, somewhat confusing road. As we draw this year to a close, it's time to move on... ..to a new phase of our lives. Pray nothing crazy happens again because are The Avengers even a thing anymore? Does anyone even have a plan? I have a plan. OK, first, I'm gonna sit next to MJ on the flight. Mm-hm. Second, I'm gonna buy a dual-headphone adaptor and watch movies with her the whole time. OK. Three, when we go to Venice... Venice is famous for making stuff out of glass, right? True. So I'm gonna buy her a black dahlia necklace because her favourite flower is the black dahlia because of, well... The murder. The murder. Four, when we go to Paris, I'm gonna take her to the top of the Eiffel Tower, give her the necklace. Oh. Then, five, I'm gonna tell her how I feel. Then, six, hopefully she tells me she feels the same way. Oh, don't forget step seven. Step seven? Don't do any of that. Why? Because we're gonna be bachelors in Europe, Peter. Ned. Look, I may not know much, but I do know this - Europeans love Americans. Really? More than half of them are women. OK. Sure. But I really like MJ, man, OK? She's awesome, she's super funny in a kind of dark way. Sometimes I catch her looking at me, I feel like I've stood up... She's coming. Don't say anything. What up, dorks? Excited about the science trip? Hey, we're talking about the trip. Yeah, and Peter's plan. You have a plan? I don't... I don't have a plan. No, he's just gonna collect tiny spoons when we're travelling to other countries. Like a grandmother? I'm not collecting tiny spoons. He's collecting tiny spoons. Oh, OK, well... ..that was a real roller-coaster. By the way, travel tip - you should download a VPN on your phone, so the government can't track you while we're abroad. Smart. Will do. SCHOOL BELL RINGS Ugh. Dude, I think that went really great. WOMAN: When I Blipped back to my apartment, the family that was living there was very confused. The wife thought that I was a mistress. The grandma thought that I was a ghost. It was... It was really a mess. Thank you all for coming out to support those who have been displaced by the Blip. And, of course, thanks to our very own Spider-Man! CHEERING CLEARS THROAT Thank you, Miss Parker, for having me. And thank you, you guys, for having me. And thank you, Spider-Man. He'll be right back out to take photos and videos. Thank you! CHEERING That was amazing. That was great. That was so cool. I was so nervous. I was a little stiff. I wasn't in the pocket.

CLATTERING Hey, sorry I'm late. Happy. Hey. Oh, you look lovely. Thanks. You too. Thank you. New dress? Yeah, yes, it is. It's a new beard. It's my... My Blip beard. I grew it in the Blip. It's a Blip beard. I see. Yeah. The reason I'm late is because this was misplaced at the office. Can you believe it? Because it's enormous. Not the amount, the size. The amount's nice too. They're generous. Oh, ha-ha. Pepper said, sorry she couldn't be here. Yeah. Thank you. I think I'm gonna go change the Sterno under the vegan lasagne. Spider-Man, go shake hands. Will do. What just happened? Heads up, Nick Fury's calling you. Fury's gonna call me? Why? Yeah. Why? He probably has hero stuff for you to do. You're a superhero. He calls superheroes. If it was that important, he'd probably call someone else, not me. CELLPHONE BUZZING Apparently not. No caller ID. That's him. I don't wanna talk to Fury. Answer the phone. Why? If you don't talk to him, I have to, and I don't want to. Why not? Because I'm scared. Answer the phone. You sent Nick Fury to voicemail? Yeah. You don't send Fury to voicemail. Hear that? They're calling me. I got to go. You got to talk to him. I'm gonna call him. I promise you, I'm gonna call him. I will. You do not ghost Nick Fury. I promise you, I'll call him. After my trip. Hey! CELLPHONE RINGS Yeah, hi... No, no, he's not ghosting you. ALL SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY OK, one question at a time. Are you the head Avenger? Are you the head Avenger now? Uh, no, I'm not.

You should pack your suit, just in case. I have a tingle about it. Please stop saying \"tingle,\" May. No. No. No, I'm not. NED: Yeah! MAN: Can you help me get my stuff up? WOMAN: Oh, sorry, that's mine. MAN: No worries. Middle seat gets both armrests. GIRL: Give me a tablet. Do you want the first shift or the second? I could take either. Give me the third shift. I took an Ambien. I can't chaperone these kids alone. Yo, Parker. This is called an airplane. It's like the buses you're used to, except it flies over the poor neighbourhoods instead of driving through them. - Ma'am? - Mm-hm? He Blipped, so technically, he's 16, not 21. I'll take that. She's lying. I don't even know this girl. Classic MJ, right? Did you know Brad was coming? It... It's so weird. One day, he's that kid who cried and got nosebleeds all the time, and suddenly, we Blip back, and he's totally ripped and super nice and all these girls are after him. Not all the girls are after him. No, man, they're all after him. Yeah. Here. Anyway, on to more important things. It's a nine-hour flight. We can play Beast Slayers the whole time. WOMAN: Are you excited? I need your help to Sit next to MJ. Seriously? Yes, seriously. What about our plan? American bachelors in Europe. That's your plan. That's a solo plan. Come on, this is my plan. Please. SIGHS Hey, guys. There's an old lady in front of us wearing a crazy amount of perfume, and it's kind of setting off Peter's allergies. Uh, Betty, if you could switch seats with him, that would be... He's allergic to perfume? Yeah, yeah, because it... It makes his eyes water, and he can't really... Peter has a perfume allergy? Oh, uh... From experience, perfume allergies are no joke. I can feel hives breaking out already. MJ, stand up. Ned, take MJ'S Spot. MJ, you take my spot. Peter, let's get you out of there. MJ: Sorry. HARRINGTON: Zach and Sebastian, you take Ned and Peter's seats. BRAD: That's all right. Ned, thanks for bringing this to my attention. Your safety is my responsibility. And Mr Dell's, but he's... SNORES I got it for now. Let's go, Peter! Let's go! Yeah, I have a small bladder, so I took the aisle. So did you want to play Beast Slayer? Nope. Have you ever played any kind of PC game or...? No. Got it. CLEARS THROAT Did I tell you how my wife pretended to Blip out? Turns out, she ran off with a guy in her hiking group. We had a fake funeral for her. Well, the funeral was real because I thought she was really dead. Wanna see the video? Oh, I got a dual-headphone adaptor if you want to watch a movie. Only if it's depressing. Or hilarious. Oh, you have a dual-headphone adaptor. We can watch together. WOMAN OVER PA: Good afternoon, this is your captain speaking. Our flight time will be eight hours, 49 minutes to Venice, Italy.

Uh, well, we got to talking on the plane, and it turns out, we have a lot in common. So we're boyfriend and girlfriend now. Whatever happened to being an American bachelor in Europe?

Boh. What? Boh. The most perfect word. Italians created it, I just discovered it. What does it mean? It can mean a million things. \"I don't know.\" \"Get out of my face.\" \"I don't know\" and \"Get out of my face.\" It's the best thing Italy created, except for, maybe, espresso. Oh, so you've been drinking espresso. Eh. Hey. German? American. A rose for you. Boh. Whoa. \"Boh\" is my new superpower. It's like the anti-\"aloha.\" I was born to say this word.

I don't know, but he's kicking that water's ass. YELLS CRASHING TRIUMPHANT MUSIC CHEERING ALL: Yeah! Yeah! REPORTER SPEAKING ITALIAN ON TV It's aliens. It has to be. BuzzFeed says there's a sailor named Morris Bench who was exposed to an experimental underwater generator and got hydro powers. Yeah, you should definitely believe everything you read on the Internet. Spider-Man could take him. What do you think it is? Being a man of science... ..witches. No, no, no. We wanna stay. Good thing I packed your suit. I can't believe you forgot it. Yeah. So who was that guy that you were with? Was that Mr Strange? Doctor Strange, May. Doctor Strange. And, no, I don't know who that was. It was a new guy. I was trying to help him... Happy, that's my lunch. Don't eat that one. Happy's there? Yeah, it's Happy. He's here. He came by to volunteer. And he's hanging around the office. And he wants to say hi. I don't want... Hi, Peter. Hey, Happy. Sorry, I'm working hard here. I got to do a... A leaflet drop. What are you doing...? Glad you're having a good time. Don't worry, I'm really taking care of your aunt. MAY: So, how's the plan going? There's been setbacks, for sure. Don't overthink it. Trust your instincts and you'll be fine. I know. Love you. Bye. Who is that guy? He's like Iron Man and Thor rolled into one. He's all right. He's no Spider-Man. What is it with you and Spider-Man? What? He's just awesome, OK? He protects the neighbourhood and he's inspiring. He inspires me to be a better man. What's up, dickwad? Thought you drowned. SPEAKING IN ITALIAN Sounds like his name's Mysterio. \"L'uomo de misterio\" is Italian for \"man of mystery.\" They don't actually know who he is. Mysterio. BOTH: Cool name. BOTH: Babe. So how much of that did you see? Not much. I was running. Right. Me too. I was also running... away. So, Paris tomorrow. Go to the Eiffel Tower. Should be great. Yeah, I read it was secretly built as a mind-control antenna to create an army of the insane. Oh. Which is why it's my favourite destination on the whole trip. What are you gonna do about the water monster? Nothing. It's dead. Besides, that Mysterio guy's all over it. I just wanna spend some time with MJ. We were talking about Paris, and I think she really likes me. NED: That's nice. Reminds me of when Betty and I first fell in love. I had just finished my fruit cobbler, right, and... You're a very difficult person to contact, Spider-Man. You're Nick Fury. And you just shot Ned. FURY: It's a mild tranquilliser. He'll be all right. So good to finally meet you. I saw you at the funeral, but I didn't think that was a good time to exchange numbers. That would've been inappropriate. That's what I just said. Right. The important thing is, you're here. I tried to bring you here. You avoided me, and now you're here. What a coincidence. Wait. Was this a coincidence? I used to know everything. Then I come back five years later, and now I know nothing. No intel, no team. And a high school kid is dodging my calls. Here's what I do know... A week ago, a village in Mexico was wiped out by a cyclone. Witnesses say that cyclone had a face. SNORING Three days later, a similar event in Morocco. A village was... KNOCK ON DOOR Just making the rounds. See if anyone needs any counselling after today's traumatic events. No, we'll be OK. We're fine. Thank you. Great because I'm... I'm not qualified to actually... Oh, he's passed out. I'm not qualified to do it anyway, so goodnight. That was my teacher. Sorry about that. You were saying? A village was destroyed by what may well be another world-threatening... BETTY: Babe, you still awake? You're not answering any of my texts. Um... He's asleep, Betty. BETTY: Oh, already? PETER: Mm-hm. Yeah. BETTY: OK. That's why it's imperative... KNOCKING DELL: Hey, boys. So that canal water today was filled with dangerous bacteria... Another person touches that door, we are going to attend another funeral. Suit up. DELL: Let me know if you start vomiting. Stark left these for you. Really? \"Uneasy lies the head that wears the crown.\" Stark said you wouldn't get that because it's not a Star Wars reference. SNORTS You can lose the mask. Everyone here has seen you without it. You'd be feigning anonymity and breathing through spandex for no good reason. Come on. Yeah. Over there, we have Maria Hill. That is Dimitri. COCKS GUN And this is Mr Beck. Mysterio? What? Doesn't matter. It's just what my friends have been calling you. Well, you can call me Quentin. You handled yourself well out there today. I saw what you did with the tower. We could use someone like you on my world. Thanks. I'm sorry. Your world? Mr Beck is from Earth. Just not yours. BECK: There are multiple realities. This is Earth Dimension 616. I'm from Earth 833. Sorry, you're saying there's a multiverse? I thought that was theoretical. That changes how we understand the initial singularity. We're talking about an eternal inflation system. How does that even work with all the quantum...? It's insane. Sorry. It's really cool. Don't ever apologise for being the smartest one in the room. Anyway... They were born in stable orbits within black holes. Creatures formed from the primary elements - Air, water, fire, earth. The Science Division had a technical name. We just called them Elementals. Versions of them exist across our mythologies. Turns out the myths are real. Like Thor. Thor was a myth, now I study him in my physics class. These myths are threats. They first materialised on my Earth many years ago. We mobilised and fought them, but with each battle, they grew, got stronger. I was part of the last battalion left trying to stop them. All we did was delay the inevitable. The Elementals are here now, attacking the same coordinates. Our satellites confirm it. Thank Mr Beck for destroying the other three. There's only one left - Fire. The strongest of them all. The one that destroyed my Earth. It's the one that took my family. I'm sorry. And it will be in Prague in approximately 48 hours. We have one mission: Kill it. And you're coming with us. I'm sorry, did you say Prague? Heh. Mr Fury, this all seems like big time, you know, huge superhero kind of stuff. And I'm just a friendly neighbourhood Spider-Man, sir. Please. You've been to space. I know, but that was an accident. There's got to be someone else you can use. What about Thor? Off-world. OK, um, Doctor Strange. Unavailable. Captain Marvel. Don't invoke her name. Sir, look, I wanna help. I do. But if my aunt finds out I left my class trip, she'll kill me. And if I'm seen in Europe after the Washington Monument, my class will figure out who I am, then... Then the whole world will figure out who I am, and then I'm done. OK. I understand. I'm sorry, what? Why don't you get back before your teachers miss you and become suspicious. Dimitri. Take him back to the hotel, please. Yes. Thank you, Mr Fury. And, uh, good luck. See you, kid. Yeah, see you. Bye, ma'am. HILL: Yeah. Drink lots of water. I'm gonna get you a vitamin C pill. You cannot get sick, OK? OK. Thanks, baby. Hey, are you sure you're good? Oh, dude, I'm fine. OK. Nice. Don't worry. Getting tranq'd in the neck by Nick Fury, probably the coolest thing to ever happen to me. It is pretty awesome. Yeah. I'm happy I don't have to go to Prague. Seriously. Good news. We're going to Prague. Huh? What? ALL: Prague? Yeah. Tour company called. They upgraded us. You should've heard me on the phone with them. I really gave them hell. All I heard was crying. Look at our upgraded ride. Whoa, bro, you see that? It's pretty sick. I'm impressed, Mr Harrington. Oh, come on. Peter, what...? What's going on? I think Nick Fury just hijacked our summer vacation. I'm Mr Harrington to the kids, uh... BOY: Oh, all right. OK. Awesome. Yeah. Awesome. MUSIC: Slnko by Marcela Laiferova Yo, what's up, Flash Mob?

No. But you have access to all of Tony's protocols. Cool. Would you like to see what I can do? EDITH stands for \"Even dead, I'm the hero.\" Tony loved his acronyms. Yeah, he did. I have access to the entire Stark Global Security network, including multiple defence satellites, as well as back doors to all major telecommunication networks. Whoa. IS MJ texting? No. Don't look at it. Don't look at it. That's wrong. That's wrong. Petrol and toilets. Ten minutes! Flash Mob, this is what we doing out here... Toilet, toilet, toilet. Which way to the toilet? HARRINGTON: Ten minutes, everyone. Dimitri, where exactly are we? OK. I'll figure it out. Oh, my gosh, it's so sick. It's beautiful. What? Hello. Close the door. Um... I'm Peter Parker. Take off your clothes. Excuse me? You told Fury Spider-Man cannot be seen in Europe. So I made you this, another suit. Oh, uh, thank you. I'm sure it fits fine. I don't need to try...

Just... Yeah. What are you doing? I'll leave you alone. Oh, my God. Don't shoot anybody. Brad? It's not what it looks like, buddy. Hey, man, look, that's... Look, Peter, I'm not here to judge your life choices, dude. If you want to hook up with some random European chick, that's on you. That's not what that was. I can't pretend I didn't see what I saw. I know you're trying to get with MJ. It's obvious. But I like her too. Wait a minute. Hey, hey. You cannot show her that photo, dude. I'm sorry, man. I have to. She deserves the truth. OK, put your one foot in front of the other, and, everybody, back on the bus. HARRINGTON: It's been ten minutes. Let's go! CHATTERING FLASH: What's up, Flash Mob? It's your boy, Big F... EDITH? Hello, Peter. How can I help you? Hey. There's this guy in my class who's gonna ruin everything with MJ... Peter, I'm having difficulty hearing you. Can you please speak up? Um, Brad Davis. He has a photo of me. Brad Davis. Is he a target? Is Brad a target? Um... Yeah. He's a target. He's a target. Copy that. Target is Brad Davis. Initiating strike. Initiating what, now? Intercept point determined. Releasing kill vehicle. EDITH. Oh, my God. Dope glasses, Parker. How'd you pay for these? Flash, give them back. I'm really paying you a compliment. Please give me...

I know you think none of us have noticed, Peter... What? But your new look, I love it. Right, babe? Thanks. NED: Yeah. Sophisticated, classy, very European. Oh, man. Let's try that again.

Put it on and await further instructions. Understood? Yes, ma'am. Yeah. Hey, man. Hey. Look, I am so sorry if I seem like I'm preoccupied with my relationship. I'm still your guy in the chair. No, it's all good. Don't worry about it. OK. Great, great. It's fine. So, what's the status on the Elemental thing? Where's it gonna happen? Uh... Here in the city. We're here. I know. It's not good. I'm figuring it out. You have to do something, please. We're all counting on you. Ned. Yeah. Yeah, babe. HARRINGTON: The good news is, we've all got our own rooms. BOY: It's about time. GIRL: Serious? FURY: Parker? Parker! Yes, sir. That thing is going to be here in a few hours. Are we boring you? He's not bored. He's thinking about how you kidnapped him. He had obstacles. I removed them. They still won't evacuate the city. Idiots. So, what's the plan, Parker? I will be in the cathedral tower, keeping watch for the fire monster. When that shows up, I will radio you guys, and then Mr Beck and I will... My name is Mysterio. That's when Mysterio and I will move in. BECK: Peter, listen to me. The best hope you have, the only hope, is to stop it here now, no matter what the cost. Manoeuvre it away from civilians if you can, but most important, keep it away from metal. If it gets too big, it'll draw power from the Earth's core. After that, there's no way to stop it. Hey, my friends are here. I can't help but think we're putting them in danger. You're worried about us hurting your friends? You, who called a drone strike on your own school tour bus? Stark gave you a multibillion-dollar AR tactical intelligence system, and the first thing you do with it is try and blow up your friends. It's clear to me that you were not ready for this. Fury asked me to come up here and see how you were doing. He just... He felt bad about snapping at you. Really? You guys do have sarcasm on this Earth, right? How you feeling? Uh... I didn't think I was gonna have to save the world this summer. I know that makes me sound like such a jerk. I just... I had this plan with this girl that I really like... and now it's all ruined. You're not a jerk for wanting a normal life, kid. It's a hard path. You see things. You do things. You make choices. People look up to you... ..and even if you win a battle, sometimes they die. I like you, Peter. You're a good kid. There's a part of me that wants me to tell you, just... turn around, run away from all this. Then there's another part of me that knows what we're about to fight, what's at stake, and I'm glad you're here. Me too. But you're worried about your friends. Yeah. Just always feel like I'm putting them in danger. Look, just get them inside and keep them in a safe place for just a few hours. They'll be all right. It's really nice to have somebody to talk to about superhero stuff, you know? Anytime. And, hey, we survive this, you'll have all summer to kill Brad. See you out there. All right. SPEAKS IN ITALIAN Sorry, that's Italian. OK. EDITH? Oh, come on. Hello, Peter. Hey. Uh... I need a way to keep my friends inside the next few hours. Let's see what we can do. Good news. We're going to the opera! You're kidding me. The opera? Don't look at me. What happened to the carnival? This is upgrade living. Come on. The tour company just gave us these tickets. For free! Do you have any idea how much opera tickets cost? No, because none of us have ever wanted to go to the opera, ever. Uh... I think this is gonna be culturally enriching for us. Thank you, Ned. Everyone, this is gonna be, maybe, the best four hours of our whole trip. ALL: Four hours? Guys, I think this is gonna be really fun. Seriously. I bet now you're all happy I had you pack a nice outfit. Yeah, because we'd much rather go to a four-hour opera instead of the biggest party in the world. Again, don't look at me. HILL: Parker, do you copy? Comm check, one, two. OK, here we are. Beat the rush. Yeah, the rush out. Lucky for us, we got the best seats in the house. DELL: Let's go. Hey. I'll save you a seat. You look really pretty. And therefore, I have value? No, that's not what I meant at all. I was just... I'm messing with you. Thank you. You're welcome. You look pretty too. Thank you. Oh, my gosh! Opera glasses! So cute. Can I...? Yeah. Want to go in on a pair? You mean, sit next to each other? Yeah. FURY: Are you in position? No. OK. No... Why the hell not? Parker? You don't want to sit next to me, or, no, you just don't want the glasses? I didn't mean that. Uh... If you go ahead, I'll go grab us a pair. I'll save you a seat next to me. A lot of seats, so I'll be up there. Awesome. OK. FURY: Parker. No, I'm coming. I'm... Hey, I got to go. Could you tell MJ that I'm sick or something? OK. Be careful. And whatever you do, please steer the monster away from the opera house. Yeah, Ned, I know. OK. OK? Yeah. Gotta go. INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE ORCHESTRA PLAYING FURY: Parker! You better be on your way. Coming. MAN SINGING Where do you think she's going? To the carnival? Oh, I... I don't... We should go. Yes, we should go. Come on, let's go. Come on. All right. I'm in position. As soon as I see something, Beck, I'll... I'll let you know. BECK: Roger that. FURY: How's the suit? The suit's great. It's awesome. It's a little tight around the old web-shooter. FURY: Parker! OK, I'll shut up. Oh, my God, babe, isn't this beautiful? Yeah, it's real beautiful, babe. What's wrong? You know, honestly, I just... I don't do well with big crowds, so maybe we should... I have the perfect thing. Come on. Don't worry, babe. We'll get away from the crowds, get some fresh air. You'll feel a thousand times better. Energy spiking. We have seismic activity. CROWD YELLING ROARING OK, he's here! Beck, you ready? You know what to do. On your lead, Spider-Man. BETTY: No, come back! Come back and help us! You're up, kid. Wait, wait. Is that...? Oh. Do you think that's Spider-Man? Uh... No, no, no. It's a European rip-off version of him. I actually read about him. It's not him. ROARS CAROUSEL MUSIC PLAYS SPIDER-MAN: No, Beck! He's got the carousel! He's getting bigger! What's his name? What's his name? Uh... It's Night... Night Monkey. Night Monkey? Yeah. Yeah. Night Monkey! Yeah. Night Monkey. Night Monkey, help! BETTY: Save us! Night Monkey, we're stuck! SPIDER-MAN: What? PETER: Oh, no, no. BETTY: Help us! Help! ROAR MYSTERIO: Are you OK? On to Plan B? Yeah! We got to hit him with something he can't absorb! I go left, you go right! Now! OK, shoot him! Yeah! That hurt him. Keep it coming. MYSTERIO: Spider-Man, keep your distance. SPIDER-MAN: I'm trying! MYSTERIO: Can't let him get near the Ferris wheel. SPIDER-MAN: OK. I'm on it! Aah! Whoa! Whoa! SPIDER-MAN: Whoa, what is that?! Betty! Betty! SPIDER-MAN: That's it! Nice! Nice! You got him! MYSTERIO: No, no, no. It's too late. MYSTERIO: Whatever happens... I'm glad we met. Beck, what are you doing? MYSTERIO: What I should have done last time. YELLING Beck, don't do it! Beck! Mr Beck? Oh, thank God. HE GROANS I would kiss you, but I think I threw up in my mouth a little. I might have a mint. So it's over? That was the last of them. But not the last threat we'll ever face. We need to stay vigilant. There's a void in this world for someone like you. Hill and I are going to Europol headquarters in Berlin tomorrow. You should join us. Thank you. I just might take you up on that. You got gifts, Parker, but you didn't wanna be here. Mr Fury, I... I'd love to have you in Berlin too. But you got to decide whether you're going to step up or not. Stark chose you. He made you an Avenger. I need that. The world needs that. Maybe Stark was wrong. Was he? The choice is yours. Let's get a drink. I'm not 21. Hey. You got to celebrate. We did something good tonight. Yeah. Fury was right. Tony did a lot for me... so I owe it to him, to everybody. Do you? Yeah. I mean... Mr Stark gave me the chance to be more. He wanted me to be better than him. And Fury wants me to live up to that. What do you want? What do you mean? What do you want? I don't know. What do you want? Peter Parker. Now. I know you're thinking about it. I wanna go on my trip. I want to go back on my trip with my friends. And go to the top of the Eiffel Tower with the girl who I really like and tell her how I feel... ..and give her a kiss. Oh. Shut up, man. You're not gonna do that, are you? No, I can't. Why not? Because I have too much of a responsibility. SPEAKS IN CZECH My God. Thank you so much. What are those? Are those the...? EDITH glasses, yeah. They were just on the floor? Try them on. Let's see how they look on you. Yeah? Yeah. I actually really like them. Can I be completely honest with you? Please. They look really stupid. Oh. But maybe they have a contact-lens version. You try them on. No, come on. Try them on. I don't wanna try them on. Just put them on. What do you think, kid? \"Next Tony Stark, I trust you.\" \"For the next Tony Stark, I trust you.\" What? Stark left me a message with those glasses: \"For the next Tony Stark, I trust you.\" I'm still not following. How many lemonades have you had? He knew every mistake I ever made. He must've known I wasn't ready for something like this. Why give it to you? Maybe he didn't trust me to have EDITH, he just trusted me to pick who should. It makes much more sense. He knew I'd do what's right. And he's not gonna give them to Fury because Fury would give himself EDITH. You're probably right. Right, so the world needs the next Iron Man. And it's not me. I'm a 16-year-old kid from Queens. It needs to be an adult with some experience and that's good like Tony Stark, like you. No. Peter, come on. No. EDITH? Hello, Peter. Hi. Yeah, um... I'd like to transfer your control over to Quentin Beck. Peter, what are you doing? Doing the right thing. Any transfer will require confirmation. Stark gave you the glasses. Stark gave me a choice. It's my choice to make, OK? And I'm gonna make it. You're a soldier, a leader. You stopped the Elementals. You saved my life. You saved the world, OK? He'd want you to have them. Waiting for confirmation. Confirm. Welcome to the Avengers. They look good on you. BECK: Thank you. It's an honour. Yeah. Mr Stark would've really liked you. Where you headed? I'm gonna go find MJ. Good luck, kid. I'll give you a fifty-fifty chance. You're pretty awkward. Yeah. See you later, man. See you. See? That wasn't so hard. Yes! Somebody get this stupid costume off me! BECK: OK, we got EDITH. Get these connected to our system. ALL CHANTING: Toast! Toast! Toast! No, this is a big win, but we still got a lot of work to do. Toast! Toast! Toast! Yeah! OK, toasts! Give me that, Doug. To the man who brought us all together, our former boss, Tony Stark. ALL: Boo! The jester king. Literally wrapped in wealth and technology that he was unfit to wield. Like the holographic system I designed. A revolutionary breakthrough with limitless applications that Tony turned into a self-therapy machine and renamed... Binarily Augmented Retro-Framing, or BARF. AUDIENCE LAUGHS Oh, $611 million for my little therapeutic experiment. BECK: He renamed my life's work \"BARF.\" I told him it was a mistake, that my technology could change the world. And then... ..he fired me. Said I was... ..unstable. To Tony. ALL: To Tony! Next, to William. ALL: William! Tony Stark was able to build this in a cave! With a box of scraps! BECK: The integration of my illusion tech with your weaponised drones was brilliant. Powerful illusions, real damage, worked like a charm. And it's just the beginning. Thank you, brother. To Guterman. WOMAN: Guterman! MAN : To Guterman! The story you created of a soldier from another Earth named Quentin fighting space monsters in Europe is totally ridiculous and apparently the kind of thing people will believe right now. I mean, everybody bought it. WOMAN: Gutes! MAN: Guterman! To Victoria. ALL: To Victoria! Staging electromagnetic pulses at each attack site so Fury's own satellites would confirm our lies. Inspired idea. To Janice. ALL: Janice! After Tony died, she was the one who discovered that EDITH was being handed over not to us, not to the Defence Department, but to a child. - Thank you. - To Janice! And to the rest of you, Tony Stark is gone. There is a window of opportunity, and someone will step up. But these days, you can be the smartest guy in the room, the most qualified, and no one cares. Unless you're flying around with a cape or shooting lasers from your hands, no-one will even listen. Well, I've got a cape and lasers. With our technology and with EDITH, Mysterio will be the greatest hero on Earth! Yeah! Then everyone will listen! Not to a boozy man-child. ALL: No! Not to a hormonal teenager. ALL: No! To me... and to my very wealthy crew. To us. To us. To Mysterio! ALL: To Mysterio! To Peter Parker. ALL: To Peter Parker! Poor kid. Let's get to work. Peter, oh, my God. Hey. Hey. We almost died. It's fine. It's fine. Hey, I'm done with the mission. Dude, the trip's over. What? There's monsters coming out of the ground. Of course our parents want us home. Don't put me on hold. Peter, you're not dead. Oh, my God. Yes, good. Stay here. Don't... Put some clothes on. We're booking flights. We came for science, we're leaving because of witches. Welcome to the new Dark Ages. What is going on? We're going home in the morning. No, no. All the Elementals are gone. BETTY: Ned. Coming, sweetie. Hey, can you guys keep it down? I'm live-streaming. Yeah. Hey. Hey. Where were you? Um, I got lost. We were worried about you. Oh. Good thing you're back. Yeah. So much for Paris. It would've been fun. Yeah. Night. Night. You look ni... OK. Oh! Hey! Hey. Look, um... I'm not ready for this trip to be over yet, and I kind of want to do something fun that's not on the itinerary or planned or with Mr Harrington. Yes. \"Yes,\" like you wanna go? Yes. Awesome. I'll see you outside in ten minutes. Meet me outside in five minutes. Five is good. OK. OK, bye. Bye. Heh. SPEAKING IN CZECH PETER: Hey! MJ: Hey! Where do you wanna go? Who cares? Awesome. OK. Let's go. PETER: I'm glad we're doing this. Yeah, me too. See the city a little bit. They used to execute people on this bridge. They would put them in a basket, and they would drown in the water. Sorry. It's OK. There's this thing I've been wanting to talk to you about for a while. Yeah? It's our last night in Europe, and I had this plan that I wanted to tell you. I'm just gonna tell you. MJ, I... \"I'm Spider-Man.\" What? That's what you were gonna say. That you're Spider-Man. No. I'm not Spider-Man. I've been watching you for a while now. It's kind of obvious. I'm not Spider-Man. What would make you think that I was Spider-Man? Peter, Washington? Yeah? The fact that you disappear out of nowhere for no reason. No, I was sick. Remember? I had my... The tummy? Susan Yang thinks you're a male escort. What? Of course I'm not a male escort. Then you're Spider-Man. I'm not Spider-Man at all. What about tonight? You snuck off, and you fought that thing. I saw you. You can't have seen me because I'm not Spider-Man. Also, on the news, it was the Night Monkey. The Night Monkey? Yeah. That's what it said on the news, and the news never lies. Night Monkey. OK. What are you doing? Well, do the Night Monkey and Spider-Man use the same webs? I mean, maybe. Maybe he's a Spider Monkey. Who knows? Were you only watching me because you thought I was Spider-Man? Yeah. Why else would I be watching you? Doesn't matter. Just thought that maybe... CLANG What the hell was that? I don't know. What is it, some kind of projector or something? Yeah, but it's really advanced. It... It looked so real. It... Yeah, really real. Wait, does that mean that...? The Elementals are fake? That doesn't make any sense because we were there, right? There was fire and destruction, and... Who would do something like that? Mysterio. I am Spider-Man. And I've really messed up. Wait. You're being serious? Mm-hm. You're 100% serious? Because it's not funny. No, I'm not joking. Because I was... I was only like 67% sure. MJ: So why are you here? Why are you on this school trip? I know you have a lot of questions, but we have to get out of here, OK? OK. OK. I can't believe I figured it out! MYSTERIO: You took everything from me! This is for my family! YELLING BECK: Pause. Pause. Oop. Sorry. Yeah, can you just fast-forward to the end? Yep. Stand by. All right, fly, fly, fly, zap, zap, zap. Pause. I'm not in love with this choreography, but it'll do. Kill image. De-cloak drones. All right, weapons. You want to weaponise? Yep. Weapons only. Stand by. WILLIAM: Nice. Stop. Something. I don't know what it is. It's something... Just dou... You know what? Double the damage and then run it again. You want me to double it up? Yeah. All right. Cover your ears. Whoo! That is good! That's good. We on schedule? Oh, yeah. Uploading software hack to EDITH network. With her drones, we'll create an event big enough to cover an entire city. All right, well done. Make sure every drone is weapons-hot. We need maximum damage. That is gonna cause a lot of casualties. BECK: Oh, yeah. More casualties, more coverage. I got to cut through the static. London is a beautiful city, and it will suffer, but they can rebuild. If I'm the next Iron Man, I need to save the world from an Avengers-level threat. But when its new saviour descends, all those casualties will be forgotten. Janice, you'll be in position with my quick-change armour for the victory lap? Of course. Do you wanna try...? No, no, that's... What's going on with my hand? Why is that happening? Oh, one of the drones that came back from the plaza was missing a projector. It's fine. Wait, and you're...? You're telling me this now? It's... It's one drone. The image will be perfect, I promise. That projector is evidence. It's going to tell people what we're doing and how we're doing it. I am trying to fool 7 billion people here, including Nick Fury, who happens to be the most paranoid and most dangerous person on the planet. If he catches on before I've killed him, he will put a bullet in my head. And nobody wants a bullet in their head, right? Right? William, can you look at me? Pull up EDITH. Hello, Quentin. Hi, honey. I need a level-five search, full-resource protocol for this device. Magnifying. There. Search everything going in and out of that building. Located. You know, William, one day, after I've had to kill Peter Parker because of this, I hope you remember that his blood is on your hands! I can't believe I gave Beck those glasses. How could I be that stupid? He's probably spying on me right now or sending a drone to come and kill me. You had access to killer drones? Yeah, I didn't really want them, especially after I almost killed Brad. You almost killed Brad? Look, I have to call Mr Fury and tell him that Beck's a fraud... but I think he tapped my phone. So, what are you gonna do? I need my suit, and I have to go to Berlin and talk to Mr Fury in person. Just... SHE CLEARS HER THROAT Oh, Ned, perfect. The costume looks great... for the costume party at the prince's castle. She knows. I told her. He didn't tell me. I figured it out. Oh. That's cool. Like, a long time ago. Oh. Look, Mysterio is a fraud. But he saved me and Betty's lives. He's been faking the whole thing with illusion tech. Yeah, he's using these, like, hologram projectors. Whoa. That's crazy. Yeah. So you guys were working the case together or what? It's been mostly me. Ned, I need you to call May, get her to call Mr Harrington, say she wanted me to stay with family in Berlin, OK? Got it. Easy. Wow, you guys lie with such ease. I got to go. Wait, wait, wait. The projector. You're gonna need this. Don't tell anyone about this, OK? Anyone who knows is in danger. So you know, too. It's cool. I've known first, and I've known longer, but it's not a competition. WOMAN SPEAKING CZECH OVER PA Excuse me. Do you know where...? Nacht Monkey! No, wait, I didn't... Oh, man. Get in. Mr Fury... You've got a lot of explaining to do. No, no, no, listen. Wait until we're secure. OK. CAR CHIMING Ahem. Right. CLANG So is there anything you want to tell us about your girlfriend? He's talking about EDITH. I know I made a mistake, and I'm sorry, but he is not who you think he is. Beck is a liar. Mysterio, the Elementals, it's all fake. He has some sort of illusion tech. That's how he tricked you and tricked me into giving him EDITH. It's a projector. I pulled it off the fire monster in Prague. So all that death and destruction we witnessed was created by this? No, not just this. I think he's using drones. Well, if this is true, then Beck's very dangerous and we need to be smart. Who else did you tell about this? Parker? Parker! What's wrong? It's Beck. He's here. What? Hill? PETER: No, it's just an illu... Fury! BECK: Wow, Peter, wow. I thought we were close. Fury always had to die, but not you. Stop hiding, Beck! I tried to help you walk away. Now you're making me do this. You told me, you were just a kid. You told me, you wanted to run after that girl. MJ: Help me! MJ! Oh, God! Peter, what's going on? I know this isn't real. Do you, though? MJ! MJ! Aah! GRUNTS I don't think you know what's real, Peter. Whoa! YELLS You need to wake up! GRUNTING PANTING GLASS SHATTERING I mean, look at yourself. You are just a scared little kid in a sweat suit. I created Mysterio to give the world someone to believe in. I control the truth. Mysterio is the truth. If you were good enough, maybe Tony would still be alive. SPIDER-MAN GASPING Deep down, you know I'm right. You made your choice. And all you had to do was step aside. And now you have... GUNSHOT GRUNTING Fury. Beck's people are trying to find everyone who could expose him. Who'd you tell? Um... I know you told someone, so just tell me. OK. Who did you tell? Who else did you tell?! Just Ned and MJ from my class. Maybe Ned told his girlfriend Betty, but that's it. What? You are so gullible. What? You're smart as a whip. Just a... IN BECK'S VOICE: sucker. And now all your friends have to die. Oh, my God. It's easy to fool people when they're already fooling themselves. But for what it's worth, Peter, I really am sorry. EDITH. Yes, Quentin. Access files to Peter Parker's class trip. I need them to fly home from London. GRUNTING COUGHING SNORING Hi. Where am I? Municipal holding facility. They said they found you unconscious at the train yard. Very dangerous. And we gave you the shirt because you seemed a bit cold. Thanks. You guys are nice. You speak really good English. ALL: Welcome to the Netherlands. I'm in the Netherlands right now? MAN: Yep. Bye. Guard! The guard is on a break. Probably talking to his wife. Yeah, she's pregnant. Oh, yeah? MAN: Yeah. ALL SPEAKING IN DUTCH Yeah. Yeah. Night Monkey. Yeah. You guys OK? GROUND SQUISHES PETER GRUNTS Excuse me, sir? Yeah? Could I borrow your phone? Yeah. SPEAKS IN DUTCH Everyone is so nice here. Uh... OK. OK. Pick up, pick up, pick up. Hey, hey, uh... I messed up. I need a... I need a ride. Where am I? Where am I, sir? IN ENGLISH: It's Broek op Langedijk. Hang on. Could you say that into there? Hi. It's Broek op Langedijk here. Yeah, no problem. CHUCKLES Thanks. Did you get that? ENGINE ROARS Peter? Are you OK? Happy, is that you? Yeah, of course it's me. Stop! Tell me something only you would know. Only I would know... Uh... Remember when we went to Germany? You pay-per-viewed a video in your room? They didn't list the titles, but I could tell by the price it was an adult film. And you didn't know how I knew... OK, fine! It's you. Stop. GRUNTS It's so good to see you. You'll have to tell me what the hell is going on here. OK, hold still. There we go. Ouch. I thought you had super strength. It still hurts. Happy, come on. All right, relax. Just a few more. There we go. Oh, my God, Happy. Relax. Don't tell me to relax, Happy! How can I relax when I messed up so bad? I trusted Beck. Right? I thought he was my friend. I gave him the only thing Mr Stark left for me, and now he's gonna kill my friends and half of Europe, so please do not tell me to relax. I'm sorry, Happy. I'm sorry. I shouldn't shout. I just really miss him. Yeah, I miss him too. Everywhere I go... ..I see his face. And the whole world is asking who's gonna be the next Iron Man... SNIFFLES And I don't know if that's me, Happy. I'm not Iron Man. You're not Iron Man. You're never gonna be Iron Man. Nobody could live up to Tony. Not even Tony. Tony was my best friend. And he was a mess. He second-guessed everything he did. He was all over the place. The one thing that he did that he didn't second-guess was picking you. I don't think Tony would have done what he did if he didn't know that you were gonna be here after he was gone. Now, your friends are in trouble, you're all alone, your tech is missing. What are you gonna do about it? I'm gonna kick his ass. But I mean, right now. Specifically, what are we gonna do? Because we've been hovering over a tulip field for the last 15 minutes. Right. I can't call my friends because he's tracking their phones. Give me your phone. My cellphone? Yeah. OK. Here. What's your password? \"Password.\" No, what is your password? \"Password,\" Spelled out. Head of security, and your password is \"password\"? I don't feel good about it either. Hello, governor. Cup of tea for you? I'm gonna be in London soon. They're in London. London, OK. Yeah, I need a suit. Suit? OK, um... bring up everything you have on Spider-Man. Yeah, open that. OK, no, no, no. What? Nothing. You take care of the suit. I'll take care of the music. AC\/DC'S \"BACK IN BLACK\" PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS Oh, I love Led Zeppelin. OK, can you pull up my web-shooters? Isolate the Taser webs, and reconfigure and boost the voltage to a factor of 25%, and give me complete manual control over detonation. # Forget the hearse cause I never die... # I thought Kree having sleeper cells was top secret information. Nick, satellites are picking up an EM pulse. I thought that was over. It's the biggest one yet. Where? London. OK, the company set up a city tour, and then we'll grab a bite and head to the airport. IS no-one else going to acknowledge how crazy this is? Oh, yeah, I get it. There's been nothing scientific about this science tour at all. No, I'm talking about Peter. Has no-one noticed how shady he is? Because I saw him in the back room of a rest stop with some woman in his underwear, and he's always sneaking away, like back at the opera, huh? Now he's suddenly off the trip, with his family in Berlin? Is no-one else interested in the truth? \"The very concept of objective truth is fading out of the world.\" George Orwell. Thank you, MJ. Yeah. Well, since Peter's not really here to tell his truth, what about you, Brad? Why take pictures of people in the bathroom? Yeah, what's that about? No, no, no, it wasn't like that. It was... I was trying to take a... Let's just put all this craziness behind us and have a nice, peaceful afternoon. \"Sounds great, Mr Harrington,\" said the class. OK. I'm gonna be a cool teacher right now. You got to stop doing that. It is weird. No more photos in the bathroom. Urinal or stalls. OK? HARRINGTON: Look at this, guys. Mr Harrington, this is your bus. - We got a bus all to ourselves. - Nice to see you all. Come along. I'll get this, yeah? Why not? HARRINGTON: Thank you. BOY: Yeah. Thank you, brother. HARRINGTON: All right. I have the kids. I got here as fast as I could. I did a full perimeter sweep. Nothing. Damn it. Pulse is spiking. I'll take another look. Soon as you see something, report. You're all we've got, Beck. If this is what I fear, then God help us, Fury. God help us all. OK, people, no Avengers coming. Good to go. William, launch the drones. Copy that, brother. Drones are entering the atmosphere weapons-hot. Excellent. Janice? Working on the cape. Get those wrinkles out. I could be shaking hands with the queen. Guterman? Almost in position. OK. Hit it, Victoria. Increasing pulse. Whatever this thing is, it's 100 times bigger than the previous ones. EDITH? EDITH: Yes, Quentin. Show me my loose ends. Once the show's going, execute the kill order on my command. Copy. All right. Start the show. Let's save the world, people. I don't like this. Something's definitely up. You're an FOS now. \"Friend of Spider-Man.\" And you have to remember, just stay calm. THUNDER CRASHES MJ: That doesn't look good. But it's fake, there's nothing to worry about. And the kids are in the kill zone. BECK: Great work, Guterman. PHONE BUZZES What? Happy Hogan here. I know. What do you want? Over at Mr Stark's, going through his belongings. There was a surfboard you left behind. What? People there said they didn't think Nick Fury was a surfer, but I said, \"Appearances can be deceiving.\" It's not mine. And don't ever call again. BEEP Fury's got the coded message. Your friends are at the Tower Bridge. Your boy called it London Bridge, but I figured it out. I'll scoop them up, OK? Yeah. We're close. We're close. How's the suit? Almost done. Good. Wait, wait, whoa, whoa. Before you go... ..if something happens to me, could you please give this to MJ? You'll make it back. You'll give it to her yourself. OK? You got this. I got this. Walk me through it. I know it's illusion tech. All I have to do is get inside the illusion, then I can take it down, find him, and he's just a guy, so I can take EDITH right back. Right, but last time, you got hit by a train. True, but this time... How do I explain this? Uh... I have like a sixth sense. The Peter-tingle. That's what you're talking about, right? It's not working, though. I heard it wasn't working right now. Is it? It is working. I don't know if it's working... So you got the Peter-tingle. That's the plan. I'm gonna go get your friends. You get that Peter-tingle back online. I got this. Cue the lightning. Cuing lightning. LIGHTNING CRASHES Sir, is it still safe on the top, or should we all come down? Oh, my. What did the bus driver say? Bus driver's gone. What?! GIRL: Where?! It's OK. Mr Dell and I have it under control! Oh, no. Don't drag me into this, Roger. I'm doing my best, Julius! Look... Oh, the witches are back. Oh, my God, get off the bus! OK. OK, follow me, kids. Come on, let's go! Aah! Now, that is an Avengers-level threat. ROARING This way. This way! OK. OK. Oh, my God! Flash! DELL: Follow that cursed hand. HARRINGTON: This way, kids. Follow me. It's not real, it's not real! It looks real to me! HARRINGTON: Follow me, kids! DELL: Earth, wind, fire, water. Oh, no. They joined forces like the Power Rangers. - You're thinking of Voltron. - Who? Voltron! You're thinking of Voltron! Hey, look, it's Mysterio! He's gonna save us! If Mysterio knows we know... Then we're in danger. Yeah, and so are they. We should go. Kill that witch! Pa-pow! BECK: This is for my family! Get somewhere safe, Fury. I don't see this ending well. I appreciate your concern, but I never leave my men behind. All right, comms check. Can you hear me, kid? I can. It's a little loud out here. I like the new suit. Thanks. Whoa, Peter, you sure that's not real? Yeah, it's just 100 times bigger than I expected. Still the play? Uh-huh. We need to get high enough so Beck doesn't see me coming. Copy. Stay sticky. Hey, Happy. Yeah, kid. What is it? We need to have a serious conversation about you and my aunt! Beck, report! Guterman, I need a response. Something quick and decisive. \"It's all the Elementals. They're merged into something...\" ..into something else. Something more powerful. It's drawing energy from the Earth's core. See, now, that's some bull. SIGHS Is that...? Be ready for anything. Yeah. LOUD ROAR Ah. It's not real, it's not real, it's not real! GRUNTING Whoa. That's awesome. William, I've got drones breaking formation. Maybe they hit a flock of birds. You're fine. I wanna see what's happening. I'm taking manual control. Do you see anything? Yeah. And I'm gonna kill him. I hope this works. You got me? I got you. WILLIAM: Boss, the illusion is coming apart. I see you. EDITH, give me protection. EDITH: Copy. COUGHS Just kill the illusion. Kill it. I'm not gonna kill it. They'll see. They'll see what I want them to see! Do you still need the cape? Yes, Janice. I still need the cape. Done. William, render my illusion suit. All right, hang on. The monster was full of drones! It's crazy! There you are. Easy. Who the hell is that? Ned! Happy! I got to get you guys out of here! Get on the jet! Who are you? I work with Spider-Man, OK? Get on that jet. You work for Spider-Man? I work with Spider-Man, not for Spider-Man. New plan. Into the Tower. BETTY: What? - Happy, are you OK? - We're OK. Just go get Beck. BECK: EDITH, target Spider-Man. Copy. I'll just kill the kids myself. There you are. Into the Crown Jewels vault! Yeah, go, go, go! Come on. GUNFIRE NED: Go! Into the vault! The walls are 8 feet thick. Go into the vault! What? Into the vault. Go! Take cover! OK. Yeah? MOUTHS: No. No. I see you. Get that thing out... Go! How does Cap do that?! Happy, say something, to let me know you're alive! I'm here. I'm here. Happy, thank God. I bought us some time. But not much. I'm trying to get to Beck, but I can't shake these drones! Gotcha. GRUNTS Going up! Finally. Hey, William, how we doing? Illusion almost back up. I don't know how you're gonna spin this. GRUNTING Oh, great. No webs. Are we gonna die? Nobody dies on my watch. I wasted my life playing video games, and we're gonna die. I have a fake ID, and I've never even used it. I post stupid videos daily for people to like me. Hey, if it wasn't for those stupid videos, Spider-Man would've never found you. Spider-Man...? Spider-Man follows me? I saved us, guys. If you saved us, why are we about to die? MJ! ALL: Stop it! I'm sorry, OK? I'm obsessed with telling the truth even if it hurts people's feelings. I'm in love with Spider-Man's aunt. We're sharing, right? Your lies are over, Beck. This certainly isn't ideal, but I have contingencies. EDITH? COUGHING Just give me the glasses. You want these? Come and get them. Come on, Peter-tingle. HE BREATHES OUT SLOWLY GRUNTS Why aren't these drones firing? EDITH: You're in the strike zone. The chance of getting hit is... No, fire all the drones now! GRUNTS Beck! Beck. You lied to me. I trusted you. I know. That's the most... disappointing part. You're a good person, Peter. Such a weakness. Stark was right. You do deserve them. You can't trick me anymore. EDITH, turn off the drones. EDITH: Biometric scan complete. Welcome back, Peter. EDITH: Execute all cancellation protocols? Just do it. Execute them all. EDITH: Confirmed. Give me the spear. That's a halberd. Thank you. How could you do all of this? You'll see, Peter. People, they need to believe. And nowadays... ..they'll believe anything. Is he...? Is this real? EDITH: All illusions are down, Peter. Whoo! Yeah! Hey, where you going? GRUNTS MJ. Are you OK? I'm OK. Are you OK? Yeah. Yeah. Is everybody else OK? Yeah, everyone's OK. What happened? There was just the drones, and they were following us, and then they just stopped. Was that you? Yeah. Did you get him? Yeah. Well, I... ..brought that. In case you needed some help. Thanks. Anyway, uh, there was this sweaty guy in the tower with us. I think he works for you or something. He... He gave me this. No. No. Oh, MJ, I'm so sorry. I had this stupid plan. Peter. I wrote it down, I was gonna buy you this and give it to you in Paris at the top... And you kissed me. What? What? Yeah. I don't really have much luck when it comes to getting close to people. Um... So I lied. I wasn't just watching you because I thought you were Spider-Man. That's great. Black dahlia, like the murder. The murder. Good. Yeah. Sorry it's broken. I actually like it better broken. I really like you. I really like you too. OK. I should... I should probably get back to the class. I'll go and... Yeah. I don't know. OK. Just in case. HAPPY: Yeah, no. No, May, you're right. He did great. He was strong. Yeah. I'm glad he stayed too. I got to go. I'm glad you're alive. I guess the coded message worked. \"Appearances can be deceiving.\" I'm surprised you didn't just wink in the camera. It worked. Only because I had serious doubts about Beck from the beginning. Not true. He had zero doubts. Where's Parker? He's with a girl. I need to speak with him. He'll call you. He'll...? LAUGHS OK. Great. Well, he better. Or it's your ass. And don't even think about ghosting me. # Hey, little girl I want to be your boyfriend # Sweet little girl I want to be your boyfriend... # Are you sure no-one else has figured it out? Yeah, it's not like anybody really pays attention to you. Ouch. Except for me. Aww. Thanks. Don't be late. I won't. See you later. You guys are so cute. Thanks. Uh... I was thinking we should all go on a double date or something. Oh, we broke up. Oh, we broke up. No. What? Why? Men and women grow apart, but the journey they share together will always be a part of them. You are so wise. Thank you. Hello, Gerald. Could Mother not make it? Oh. May! I promise you... Oh, he's here. Don't give me a ticket. I'm so glad you're OK. No, for real, I'm good. I'm actually really fine. Let's go. Where are your bags? Oh, right. They got blown up. Yeah. I got you some hot buttered bagels. Thank you so much. MAY: I know my boy. PETER: I kept my identity pretty guarded this past couple of years. I faced a lot of deception. And I'm tired of the lies. So it's time for the truth to be out there. Are you dating? Yes. Not really. What? Well... I think... Summer fling. Yes, that evolves and grows like any other. I still don't know where it's going to go. Open to wherever it might lead. Anywhere. On or off. To share it with people... We'll always be friends, no matter what. I'm gonna go because I've got a date. HAPPY: Because we all are interconnected. Bye. MAY: We are. Sorry! Whoa! Whoo! Woo-hoo! Hey. Sorry I'm late. Hey. It's fine. You ready? Yeah. You're gonna love this. OK! OK! OK. OK. You ready? Yeah. I'm just not gonna watch. I'm not gonna watch. I should stop looking. I'm gonna stop looking! MJ SCREAMS MUSIC: Vacation by The Go-Go's # Can't seem to get my mind off of you # Back here at home There's nothin' to do # Now that I'm away I wish I'd stayed # Tomorrow's a day of mine That you won't be in # When you looked at me I should have run # But I thought it was just for fun # I see I was wrong # And I'm not so strong # I should have known all along That time would tell # A week without you Thought I'd forget # Two weeks without you and Still haven't gotten over you yet # Vacation, all I ever wanted Vacation, had to get away # Vacation, meant to be spent alone # Vacation, all I ever wanted # Vacation, had to get away # Vacation, meant to be spent alone # Vacation, all I ever wanted Vacation, had to get away # Vacation, meant to be spent alone. # OK. You can put me down now! You can put me down now! SPIDER-MAN: You OK? Uh... Whoo. Yeah. Yeah, I'm OK. Let's just... Never, never doing that again. I'm never doing that again. OK. I should probably get out of here. Be safe. See you later. ANNOUNCER ON SCREEN: This is breaking news. We come to you with revelations about last week's attack in London. An anonymous source provided this video. It shows Quentin Beck, aka Mysterio, moments before his death. A warning, you may find this video disturbing. I managed to send the Elemental through the rift, but I don't think I'm gonna make it. Spider-Man attacked me for some reason. He has an army of weaponised drones, Stark Technology. He's saying he's the only one who's gonna be the new Iron Man, no-one else. EDITH: Are you sure you want to commence the drone attack? There will be Significant casualties. SPIDER-MAN: Do it. Execute them all. DRONES FIRING, EXPLOSIONS This Shocking video was released earlier today on the controversial news website TheDailyBugle.net. There you have it, folks, conclusive proof that Spider-Man was responsible for the brutal murder of Mysterio, an interdimensional warrior who gave his life to protect our planet and who will no doubt go down in history as the greatest superhero of all time. But that's not all, folks. Here's the real blockbuster. Brace yourselves. Spider-Man's real... Spider-Man's real name is... Spider-Man's name is Peter Parker. What the...? # RADIO: Stop your messin' around I # Better think of your future... # You got to tell him. It was fine. The little boy handled it. We helped. Talos. Come off it. How was I supposed to know that the whole thing was fake? I mean, that was all very convincing. The performances, the illusion, that costume, the craftsmanship in that. This is just embarrassing for a shape-shifter. Fine. PHONE DIALS Hey there. I hope your mission is going well. We gave the glasses to Parker about a week ago, like you said. And, uh, it was very touching, you know? Really, really quite touching. Talos. Um... And, uh, you know, shortly after that, it really kind of went off the rails, and so we need you to come back because everyone kept asking where the Avengers are, I don't know what to say to that, so you're lucky that Spider-Man won...

Lovely presents, thank you, Niall. And what did you get her, Connell? Uh...a book. Some Frank O'Hara poems. CONNELL CHUCKLES Anyway... I love it.

Wow. You all right? Mm-hm, yeah. Just got this e-mail. From who? Connell, from who? It's... It's from this university in New York. They're offering me a place on their MFA creative writing programme. Oh. I didn't even know you'd applied. I mean... ..congratulations, I'm not surprised they've offered you a place. I'm just a bit...surprised you didn't mention it. Why would...? Such a long shot. I was embarrassed. To be honest, I... ..I still look up to you a lot and I... ..I wouldn't want you to see me as, like, I don't know, deluded or... Connell. I don't even know why I applied. I wasn't even my idea. Whose idea was it? One of my tutors. It's really brilliant, Connell. You can see me in New York, can you? Yeah, actually. I can. I can't even... It's making me feel... Now is not the time for me to go halfway across the world and live in a city where I don't know anyone. Like...I could barely walk down a street in Dublin a couple of months ago without having a panic attack. How's that going to work in New York? Put it away for a bit. It's brilliant they offered you a place. Don't think about what to do with it for now. I am not going. OK. APPLAUSE And, of course, we have to thank Connell...

Well, that's impressive. No, well, I'm just really doing it as a favour. Sure, people edit newspapers as a favour. He's doing brilliantly. It's a literary magazine, it's absolutely not a newspaper. What is an underground train full of professors? A tube of smarties. Am I involved in politics? Yes. What?! No! Why is that funny? Am I Dobby? CHEERING Do I like me? Oh, no. I don't think so.

Didn't feel right to be here, to be honest. What? I've been thinking about New York. The offer. What about it? I don't know, I just... I keep imagining you being there. Writing. Right. You've been thinking about it. Yeah. A bit. Like, obviously, I've thought about it a bit, but that doesn't mean... It just feels too hard. Everything recently has been hard or it's been an effort, and maybe this year just needs to be straightforward. I don't know. There's... There's been a lot of stuff that's been difficult and painful. And this would be difficult and amazing. Potentially. It's New York. It's writing. It'd be fucking amazing, Connell. Yeah. Yeah, maybe. Would you come with me? We could be there together, and you could study or work and... Why? I want to stay here. I want to live the life I'm living. It's quite a thing. Yeah. And I'm getting better at it. Yeah. I'd miss you too much. I'd be sick. At first. But it would get better. Mm-hm, yeah. Yeah, and it's only a year and then I'd be back. Don't promise that. You don't know... ..where either of us will be... ..or what will happen. I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you. No. That's true. You'd be somewhere else entirely. You'd be a different person. And me, too. But we have done so much good... ..for one another. You know I love you. And I'm never going to feel the same way for anyone else. I know. I'll go. And I'll stay. And we'll be OK. "}

{"episode":"m00170ns","subtitles":"MUSIC: Awakening Harlan Buskes Remix Take a look at that view. Spectacular, isn't it? But it was here on the Acropolis hill that some believe Theseus's father, King Aegeus, looked out to sea, waiting for his son to return. See, Theseus had promised his father that if he defeated the minotaur, he'd hoist a white sail on his ship as a tribute. But he was so excited to get back home, he forgot and he flew the same black sail that he set out with. Well, thinking his son was dead, the heartbroken king flung himself onto the rocks below. Another victim of the cruel tricks gods play on men. Well, I hope you ladies brought your handkerchiefs, cos the next thing you're about to see has been known to make some weep at first sight. Follow me. Completed in 438 BC, the Parthenon. From the Greek word \"parthenes,\" meaning \"virgins.\" \"The ancient Greeks were masters of deception. \"Even though the base of the Parthenon appears \"straight to the naked eye, \"it is, in fact, completely crooked. \"Indeed, if one were to leave one's hat \"on one side of the temple steps, \"it would vanish altogether when viewed from the other.\" You're making this up. Oh, only one way to find out. Oh. Wanna try it? All right. Come on. All right. You go on down there, I'll put the hat right here. Mm-hmm. Off you go. Mmm-mmm-mmm! I hear that. HE CHUCKLES Is this far enough? That's perfect. Oh, my God, you're right. Really? No. Aw, jeez. Sucker born every minute. Come on, baby. I got you. Oh, well. Gosh, it's so hot. Yeah. Getting bored of the Parthenon? LAUGHTER No, no, no, no. Come on, we have to finish the bottle. I was supposed to meet my friends an hour ago. Oh, you just tell 'em you got lost. I'm a terrible tour guide. SPEAKS GREEK Let me get this. No, no, no, I got it. I got it. Thank you. My pleasure. Actually, do you have any... Small bills? Oh, umm... Change? I think so. Shall I take a look? Yeah, actually, I'm not sure. OK. All right, so it's four drachmas, so if I take five and $10, I'll give you back 200 drachmas. Good? OK. Thank you. True story. She's very pretty, isn't she? Oh, no, I was... I was looking at the guy that she was with. He reminds me of my father a little bit. It says we should go to the flea market on Sunday. Apparently it's less crowded. Don't look now, but there's a young guy in a grey shirt sitting with a girl in blue and white striped dress. He was at the Parthenon earlier, staring at me. Staring at me now. OK. Now I'm curious. Oh, I'm sorry, I don't speak Greek. Somebody's in there. You're American? Yeah. Where are you from? I'm from Trenton. New Jersey? Yeah. I thought you were Greek. I thought you were Greek. What are you doing in Athens? Uh, I'm a tour guide. Do you need one? He's an American tour guide, he's been here a year and before that he went to Yale. Do you believe him? You can ask him yourself. He's gonna show us around the flea market Sunday. \"Rydal.\" Fancy. So Colette tells me you went to Yale. Yes, sir. What did you major in? Economics. Hmm. Good training for a tour guide. Yeah, well, that wasn't the plan initially. My father had a job lined up at a friend's law firm and... And you ran away as fast as you could. Something like that. What do you do for a living, sir? Call me Chester. I look after people's savings, mostly low-risk investments. How much? HE SPEAKS GREEK 20 drachmas. There you go. A steal. You must be doing pretty well, though, if you're staying at the grand. Honey, look at this. It's beautiful, isn't it? It sure is. Actually, this is a Cretan design. You see how the snakes come together and never end? That represents immortality. People wear it as a protection charm. Oh. You like it, hon? I love it. Well, let's get it then. How much is it? HE SPEAKS GREEK 2,000 drachmas. All right, so 1,500, which is about $50. 50 bucks? Good deal. Will he take dollars? Well, you can give me dollars and I'll give him drachmas. OK. Fair enough. Thank you, honey. It looks great on you. It's gorgeous. Say, why don't you join us for dinner? Would you do that? Sure, yes, I'd love to. But I'm... I'm meeting a friend later. She can come too. Honey, that's embarrassing. No, it got so bad that we started counting how many times a day the Parisians would insult us. We got up to 15 one night, nine in the same restaurant. Was it your first time there? Mmm. Chester helped liberate Paris. Oh, really? All by myself. You fought in the war? Just the last part. Whereabouts? Normandy, the Ardennes, a few other places. Wow. Heck of a joint you picked out. It's modelled after the old Ottoman cafes. Huh. Great guide, isn't he? Mmm, wonderful. Knows everything. Mm-hm. He's an even better writer. Is that so? Mm-hm. What do you write? The most beautiful poems. He's gonna be famous one day. Happy or depressing poems? Unpublished poems, mostly. I'm sure you'll find... Sir. ..plenty of inspiration in Greece. And your first date was yesterday? The day before. Oh, the day before. That's the sound and light show. I can get you tickets if you're interested - tomorrow night, best seats in the house. Thanks, but unfortunately, we're... we're leaving tomorrow. Oh, really? Yeah, I wanted to show Colette Rome and Venice before we go back to the states, so... How about you? Any plans to go home soon? Uh, yeah, at some point, when I run out of money. Doesn't sound like you're in a big hurry. Oh, thanks. Well, Chester, I gotta figure out what I wanna do first. Sure. That's the best thing about being your age. There's a surprise around every corner. Yeah, I guess so. Did you know that she was a Van Buren? Who's that? Your friend Lauren. I only just met her. Mm-hm. Was he the seventh or the eighth president? He was the eighth. Yeah. THEY CHUCKLE No, I'm... I'm... I'm not... I know, I know. Hey, listen, I've been married twice, both times to beautiful women with no money. I'm gonna say this because I love Colette and I'm a little tanked. But... but they can be a burden. Yeah, well, I don't think she's all that interested. Oh, no? Hey, ladies. No, don't. What are you two gossiping about? None of your business. See? All right, all right. It was so nice to meet you. It was so nice to meet you. Thank you for dinner. Bye. Thanks for taking such good care of us. Good luck with your studies. My pleasure. Well, I hope we meet again sometime. Me too. Enjoy Rome. Oh. Well, we'll try. Thank you very much. Goodnight, son. Goodnight. Goodnight. Goodbye. What did you think? She's very sweet. Wouldn't trust him to mow my lawn. I thought he was... very interesting. Oh, yeah? Well, that's cos he couldn't keep his eyes off you all night. No. Does he still remind you of your father? He's a lot easier to talk to. Where are you taking us on our last day? Sounion. Wish we were staying longer. Oh, she forgot her bracelet. HE SPEAKS GREEK Everything all right in there? Uh-huh. Now we're talking. Oh, yeah. Come on. Get outta here. SHE CHUCKLES KNOCK ON DOOR No, thank you! KNOCKS AGAIN SHE CHUCKLES Uh... Parakalo. Fuck off. Ah! Just put the \"do not disturb\" on. No, thank you. Mr Donlevy? No. Your name's not Donlevy? No. No, no. I think you've got the wrong room. How about Mr McFarland? Yes. May I come in? Can I ask what this is about? Stock market. Canadian oil shares. Oh, I see. Hang on right here. I'll just get my coat and we'll go downstairs. We can talk about it right in here. No, let's just go to the bar. Right in there would be great. Sorry to barge in on your like this, ma'am. OK. Are you sure you don't want me to wait? It's fine. You get back to the hotel, all right? I'll call you in the morning. OK. Bye. You ran a brokerage firm called Donlevy & Walters back in New York. That's right. You with the embassy? No. I represent some very unhappy clients who invested their money with you. You ought to be more careful who you do business with. Listen, I'm sorry that your clients are upset, but I can't help it if the market crashes. This is a nice hotel. Just like all the other nice hotels you've been staying at. I've been following your trail all across Europe, Mr McFarland. You've been throwing a lot of cash around. How long is the trip to Mycenae? A whole day, madam. \"Semper fi,\" huh? You a marine? No. Infantry... Army. Yeah. It's funny, you know? All that time over here during the war, I could give a shit about Europe. Yet here I am again. Here's the deal... I could care less about your other investors. You reimburse my clients, I'll go back home to my family and leave you and your lovely wife alone. My wife has nothing to do with this. Look, why don't you and I go downstairs, have a drink, see if we can come to an arrangement? Unfortunately, I'm not authorised to negotiate with you. I'm just here for the money. Yeah. OK, well, let me go and get it. SMASH Chester? HE GROANS Chester? Don't come in! Hello. Hi. Hello. I need to return something to some friends of mine, the McFarlands. They're in room 505. 505, OK. Is there a phone I can use? The house phone is right over there. Ah, thank you. PHONE RINGS Don't answer it! Don't answer it. What's happening? He's fine. He fell. He hit his head pretty bad. I've got to take him downstairs, get him some help. I thought you said no-one would follow us. Open the door! Get dressed, start packing. We've gotta get out of here right away. Oh, God. No. Can you, uh... can you help me get this guy's door open? What happened? He's hammered, that's what happened. I found him in the lobby. Good evening. Evening. Easy, like this. Oh, Christ. Is he OK? He'll be fine. He's gonna have an almighty hangover tomorrow though. Who is he? I haven't the foggiest idea. Some drunk. He tried to paw Colette in the elevator, then followed us to our room, so I smacked him. Let's let him sleep it off. Oh. Your wife left it in the cab. I was bringing it back. The truth is... I owe some people money. They sent him to threaten us with a gun. Look. I don't know what to do. I mean, I... I don't know... ..if he's alone or there's somebody else in the lobby. All I know is we gotta get out of this hotel before that man wakes up. Can you help us? Thank you. Sorry, it's not The Grand. It's perfect. It feels like New York. Oh, is that you? Yeah, with my dad. Is he back home? Uh, he passed away a month ago. I'm sorry. So, uh, have you figured out who he is yet? Private detective. I got in trouble with a... gambling syndicate back home. Made some investments for 'em that didn't work out. Sent this guy after us. God knows who else. Well, the airport opens up in a few hours. You'll be gone before the guy wakes up. HE SIGHS Hotel took our passports when we checked in. You don't have your passports? Nope. Well, I... I mean, I can try to go get 'em for you, but I don't think they're gonna give 'em to me. Naw, naw, it wouldn't be safe anyway. Might be more of 'em waiting for us. I don't know. I gotta get Colette outta here. We need new passports, new identities. I have a friend that I get American cigarettes from. He might know somebody that could help you out. DOOR OPENS AND SHUTS You OK? No. He's gonna help us. We'll fly outta here soon. Where? We'll see. I'm sorry. Chester? We should go. OK, my friend can arrange the new passports for $1,000... each. So... ..half now, half on delivery or...? Niko... Excuse me. When will the passports be ready? Mmm, five days. No, no. Maybe four. We can't hang around Athens that long. For another $1,000... He can deliver the passports to Crete. Crete? Yeah, no-one's gonna look for you there. Well, that's... I mean, I don't know Crete from a hole in the ground. Where am I gonna... I'm kidding, I'm kidding. What did he say? What's the matter? No, no, no. I should come with you. What? I should come with you. No, no, no. You're not gonna know your way around. I can go with you. You would do that? Yes. I'd certainly make it worth your while. It's OK, it's... it's not about the money. No, I know, but you deserve... You have to pay him another $500. 500... so 1,500 more? Yeah. Did you give him any money for the drinks? I offered. Well, you should have insisted. He's probably too proud to accept. Trust me, he's doing fine. What's that supposed to mean? It means he already skimmed his commission. Why else do you think he's helping us? I'm sure it's not just the money. No? I think he's also got a thing for you. Either way, we need him... At least for a few more days. Hey, buddy. Coffee's cold and the beer's warm. Thank you. Welcome. Thanks. Anything interesting in the newspaper? Greeks and Turks are at each other's throats again. Hey, honey, do you mind going in and seeing what's taking him so long? Please? THEY CONVERSE IN GREEK What gives? Well, we can't check in without all three passports. Why not? It's a legal requirement. Apparently, it's the same everywhere in Iraklion. But if we go to a smaller town, they might be more relaxed about the rules. Where'd you have in mind? Chania. It's up the coast and there's a bus that leaves first thing in the morning. In the morning? Yeah. We could stay up. It's warm enough. And you can leave your suitcases here. Uh, no. I think I'll hang on to them. My father almost had a heart attack when I left home. He said, \"New York has turned its back on God.\" \"And you should be very careful, young lady.\" Oh, lord. Taverna Asterion... what is \"Asterion\"? Asterius is a minotaur. So Asterion would have been... ..Grandfather. Actually, it's the same name. Asterius, Asterion... it's just a different pronunciation. It means the same thing. But it is confusing. Mmm. Who knew? Where did you live? On Hudson and 11th. I shared an apartment with three Barnard... I'm fading. I don't know if I can stay up much longer. Well, order some coffee. I think I'm gonna have another scotch. So how did the two of you meet? I crashed one of his parties with a girlfriend. It was like nothing I'd ever seen. There was champagne and caviar and millionaires everywhere. Garcon! May I have a cigarette, please? Whiskey. And a whiskey. Thank you. Sorry. Thank you. You must be awfully... ..good at languages to pick up Greek so quickly. I had a head start. My father made me and my sisters learn different languages since we could practically speak, so every month it would be a different language... French and then Italian, then Russian. Russian? Can I keep the bottle? And the thing is when he'd overhear us speaking English we'd get demerits. There was this chart in the hall. Even my poor mother would get on it now and then. And what did your father do? He was a Professor of archaeology at Harvard. Wow. Yeah. He certainly thought so. And you don't? Listen, my old man drove a truck for a living. He didn't teach us very good English, never mind French or Russian. Impressive. Yeah. Yeah. It is. I'd like to dance. OK, yeah, all right. May I finish my scotch first? Rydal? Uh... Knock yourself out. BAND PLAYS TRADITIONAL GREEK MUSIC Are you all right? Yeah. Let me help you. I got it! Honey... honey! I just want to sit here and finish my cigarette. Are you sure you're all right? Stop asking me that! The bus leaves in a few hours. We'll just... Have to hang in there. Go ahead, I'll catch up. Hey, I hope that... You know what? Just run along, Rydal. Run along. I bet you wish you never met us. No. No, I'm glad I did. He's mad at himself. Not you. HE COUGHS Shit. Oh. Kalimera. Kalimera. Uh, kafe parakalo. Kafe? And, uh...

SEAGULLS CALL Hey. When we get our new passports, I'll straighten things out with those guys in New York. We'll be home soon. Morning. Morning. Ahem. Oh, whew. We should get going if we're gonna catch the bus. Thanks. Hey, Rydal? How long are we stopping here? I don't know. It depends how long the bus driver takes to eat. Can I get you something? Uh... Yeah, a beer'd be nice. OK. I got it. Hey, Rydal? Uh... I want to apologise for last night. I was out of line. Colette told me your dad passed away recently. I didn't know. I'm sorry. He died. It's all over the news. You have to turn yourself in. It was self-defence. They mention any suspects? No, but they have... they have your passports. It's just a matter of time. If you turn yourself in... They'll arrest you as an accomplice. Witnesses saw both of us with the body in the hotel hallway. You arranged fake passports for us. No, no, no. You accompanied us to Crete. And now you're carrying what? An extra $1,000 of my money in your pocket? I'm trying to help you. I know. I know you are. Did you know he was dead? Colette doesn't. I'd prefer it if she didn't find out. WOMAN SPEAKS GREEK I'm finally in a good mood and now you two are sulking. What's the matter? I'm just a little tired. I bet I can make you laugh. Oh, finish your O-Zo and I'll try again. It's \"ouzo.\" O-u-z-o. Four letters. Well, it tastes like gasoline to me. Hey, you want to share some oysters, hon? The guidebook says it's a bad idea to eat shellfish here. The Greeks have only been doing it for thousands of years, but I'm sure your parochial guidebook's probably right. Better to eat shellfish from some dirty New York kitchen than right here by the sea where it's caught in front of your eyes. I wish I was in New York right now. Oh, skip it. Of course we can't go back to New York. We can't go anywhere in the States because Chester's business ventures have been such a huge success. There's three of us here at the table. I'm sure Rydal doesn't want to hear you whine about how homesick you are. All right, why don't you lay off her? Who, my wife? Don't rise to it. No, let him. Let's hear what's on his mind. Don't you ever speak to me like that again. Or what? Are we gonna talk about this? We had an argument. There's nothing to talk about. Are you sure? Is there gonna be another black mark against me? Look, I got upset because I don't like you discussing my business in front of him. He could use it against us. Oh. That's ridiculous. Is it? He's done nothing but lie to us. I mean do you believe any of that Harvard Yale crap? I don't really care. It's not like we've been straight with him. Why are you defending him? Because I like him. And I appreciate what he's doing for us. You like him. I didn't mean it like that. KNOCK ON DOOR Nai? It's me. One second. SWITCHES RADIO OFF Hi. Hi. Just thought I'd take a walk, but I don't know what there is to see in this town. Uh, ruins. Your room's smaller than ours. Well, there's only one of me.

He thought that you would panic. He killed someone! Why would you lie for him? I didn't do it for him. You shouldn't have done it for either of us. Those people that are after him, what did he do? He swindled them. He sold them shares in an oil field that didn't exist. Them and hundreds of other people. How much did you know? He's my husband. I'll call my friend in the morning, see if your passports are ready. Then what? Hide some place else? Change our names? I can't live like that anymore. What do you want me to do?

Looks can be deceiving. Oh, yeah. Why didn't you go to his funeral? Cos he wouldn't have wanted me there. The problem is we expect too much from them.

{"episode":"m0012xz1","subtitles":"APPLAUSE Christmas University Challenge. Asking the questions, Jeremy Paxman. Hello. As the nation's students return home for Christmas, we likewise put our main series on pause and invite a distinguished alumni of 14 UK universities and colleges to put their fingers on the buzzers and their knowledge to the test. They all demonstrated that at least some of what they learned as students has stuck, though often stuck further out of reach than they might have hoped. After seven heats and two semifinals, two teams are left standing and the winners tonight will be crowned series champions. Now, the Edinburgh team are here thanks to victories over Leicester in round one and Bradford in the semifinals. Their knowledge of film, food and Fulbright scholars helped them score 305 points across those two matches, despite British history and Picacho being met with blank faces.

Let's hear them introduce themselves for the final time. Hello, I'm Cath Slessor.

Enjoy yourself. You OK? Yeah. I just needed a minute. My dad called earlier. Yeah. Yeah, he was drunk. Such a drunk. Every time he calls me these days. He's an alcoholic. Right. I mean, I don't really talk to him that much. I'm not a very good daughter, but... ..he gives me money for college, so... That's bad, isn't it? Is it? It just makes me feel complicit or something. In what way? I just wish I could figure things out on my own, so that he wouldn't have this sort of weird hold on me. but I don't even know how to do that, so... I guess, for now, it's the one fatherly thing that he's trying to do. Sometimes people just like to feel needed. I know I sound horrible. You don't. Sometimes I don't even know if I love him though. Like, I... I know that sounds unnatural. And he's my father, but... Just feels really stupid to have to love someone unconditionally sometimes. Like, maybe there has to be conditions. Would you draw up a contract? That would probably help. There would be a lot of clauses. KNOCK Hey. Hey. Think I'm going to go for a hike tomorrow if you want to come. Yeah.

Don't put too much pressure on yourself. If it's not coming, then... ..leave it for a bit. Thanks. Are you glad you came, Frances? Yeah. Thanks, again. Yeah, it's... It's good for us to have company. I love it when the house is full. It's... And Nick does, too. He was pretty wrecked when he got here, and he's perked up a bit, so... It's good. It's good to see. See you later anyway. Hey.

{"episode":"m0015yj1","subtitles":"I'm Gordon Ramsay, Michelin-starred chef and CEO of a global business empire. Now, the food and drink industry has never been more exciting but it's also never been tougher to succeed. So, I want to catapult someone to the next level and invest \u00a3150,000 of my own cash into their business. I've hand-picked 12 of the UK's best up-and-coming food and drink entrepreneurs, who will compete to win my investment. Over the next eight weeks, I'll set my contenders a series of challenges designed to test their character, showcase their business skills and convince me they have what it takes to win my backing. Who will be my future food star? Oh, wow. I've invited the contenders to meet me on a beach in Cornwall. Where am I going? Ah! Of course, I'm nervous because I don't know what's going to happen but I'm so excited to be here. Wow, wow, wow. Amazing. Love it. Let's do it! Oh, mint. How nice is that? So, when I meet Gordon, I think I might brick it a little bit. Yeah, definitely. This is exciting. Oh, my God. Look at the water! On this beach, everyone here is a professional in the field that they're in. Are you the kind of person that's going to, like, hesitate or are you just going to do it? You've only got one life to live and I would like to say I've done so many things. I have no idea what is about to happen. I'm a bit nervous, if I'm honest with you. I wonder where he's going to come from. Maybe he'll just come out the sea. RADIO: Two minutes out, Gord. Two minutes out. Two minutes, thank you. Now, that lot down there have no idea what's about to happen. What's he going to make us do? Oh, my God, I'm so nervous. Here we go. RADIO: What height are we there? We are 80ft here. Here he is, look! Oh, my God. Oh, my God. THEY CHEER RADIO: Hold it there. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. This is crazy. Come on, Gordon! RADIO: Here we go. What the heck? Oh, my goodness! He's ready to jump. Oh, my goodness! It's an entrance, isn't it? That's a big swim. Oh, my goodness. THEY CHEER Guy, so nice to meet you all. Is everybody ready? ALL: Yes! Right, listen carefully. I've invited you all here today because all of you have some of the most exciting food and drink businesses anywhere in the UK, but an idea is only as good as a person, who has it. And trust me, I don't just invest in a business. I invest in the person. I've designed an amazing series of challenges for you all, so I can discover your true DNA, what you're really made of. And at the end of that process, I'll invest \u00a3150,000 of my own money... ..in one of you. How does that sound? ALL: Great! Woo! Right, all of you, listen carefully. My first challenge isn't about food or drink. It's about you because it's a test of character and you're all probably wondering why I just jumped out of a helicopter. Well, let me tell you, if I'm going to take a leap of faith in you, I'd like you all to do the same for me, literally. In a moment, you're going to head over to that headland and you'll jump off that cliff into the sea. What? Are you serious? Cos I want to see how you react under pressure. Good luck, off you go. ALL: Woo! Oh, my goodness. How are you feeling about it? I'm so nervous. Yeah? Yeah. Are you scared about jumping? I'm so nervous. I'm the queen of vegan food. I want you to be able to find my vegan cake mix everywhere. When you invest in me, you're investing in a person that is not going to let you down, is going to work her hardest and is going to not stop. To be honest, I'm feeling really excited about the job. This is probably the scariest thing I've ever done. Yeah. But, yeah, I'm ready. My name is Bola. I run a brand called Jitterbug, a soft drink that is completely guilt-free. I think for this process, I will find out how competitive I can be. I'm in it to win it. So, a couple of years ago, I did something like this and I had to get down from the ledge just because I was so nervous and scared, so this is going to be great for me. I thought you were flexing for a bit. Hey, how's it going? I'm the owner of Savages Mussels, the mussels bar in Macclesfield. I want to have 12 to 15 restaurants and bars. Working with Gordon Ramsay - my passion, his knowledge as well - it would be a dream come true. Are you feeling all right, Jen? No. You're not, why? Well, the thing is, water and heights is like my worst nightmare. Yeah. I just... Yeah. THEY CHEER Here we go! Woohoo! A mile west of Newquay, on the north coast of Cornwall, is Towan Head. To get to the cliffs, they'll need to swim and scramble across the coastline, before climbing jagged rocks to the ledge, 40ft above the open water. Look at Amit with his front crawl. This is a tough challenge because there's nowhere to hide. But for me, this is not about who jumps first. It's a test of nerve. Urgh! I really need to pee. Who's got the drive, who's got the passion, and more importantly, who wants it more? You doing OK? I'm just processing it, now. After stepping off this ten-metre ledge, it's a two-second freefall into the cold sea water below. That just looks bad. These waters are dangerous, so I've recruited some local cliff- jumping experts to assist me. Straight out to the right and a nice big step out. Right, this is it. Time to jump. It's only 40 foot, OK? Only 40ft?! Let's go. Are you mad? Right, who'd like to go first? Come on, Bola. You got this. All right, so you're going to put your foot in there, OK? That's it. OK, are you ready? Go on, Bola. Go on, Bola. You've got it. It's going to be worth it. You're down in two seconds. Come on, Bola. Gordon says, \"Go on.\" So, I go! Come on, leap of faith. Well done. Leap of faith! Yes! THEY CHEER Yes, Bola! Yes! Bola, well done. Fantastic! That sounded painful. Right, who's next? Next to step up, Indian restaurateur Amit. Well done. Don't overthink it. Gordon, you've got to let me cook for you, yeah? I'll let you cook for me. Yeah? Just do the fucking jump. OK, mate. OK? Let's do it. Trust me. OK, when you're ready. I do. Let's go, bud. Right there, Amit. Let's go! Amit, well done. Next up, soft drinks entrepreneur Steph. Go on, Steph. Go on. Go on, Steph! You can do it. Go on! Go on, Steph. you got this, girl. You've got it. SHE SCREAMS Well done, Steph! Asher... Go on, Asher! ..Michelle... SHE SCREAMS ..Leah... Yes! ..Vincenzo... He thinks he's fucking Superman. ..Victoria... Well done, Victoria. ..and Jamie... Right, let's go. ..all take a leap. There are three contenders left to jump. Argh! Oh, take your time. You're fine. Next up, bottled cocktail company owner Jen. I'm just going to walk straight up and go. Yeah, let's go. Can you tell me when I'm ready to go? Yeah, I will do. Right... Go on, Jen. You've got it. Jen, you've got it. Go on, yes! Woo! Well done. Woo! No, mate, there's no chance. Matthew, let's go. Woohoo! Yes. Yes! Matthew, well done. 11 contenders have jumped... Are you all right, my darling? No. ..leaving Valentina as the only one not to. Let me say something in my defence. Of course you can. I genuinely can say to you today that I push it to my limit. What about this? If we step down... A smaller one? A smaller one. So, we do together at the same time. From down there. Yeah, but you do the big one and I'll smaller one. OK. Yeah. THEY CHEER You ready? Yeah. Let's go. One, two, three, go! Well done. Well done. Good girl. If all of the challenges are like this, I'm out. What a great day. And on the back of that performance, trust me, they're all on board. Bloody brilliant. A new day, a new challenge. It's now time to put my contenders' business skills to the test. So, what are we going to do? I have no idea. I just hope it's not going to be like yesterday. Yesterday was brutal. Oh, look at this. This is gorgeous. It's got to be fishing. I've asked the guys to meet me in Newquay Harbour for our challenge. Yesterday was all about the individuals. Today, I want to see how they work as a team. It's going to be Cornwall-related, isn't it? Clotted cream and stuff like that. Pasties. Clotted cream, pasties. Oh, there he is! Right, good morning. Line up, please. Let's have the big ones at the back, small ones at the front. Am I big or small? First of all, you smashed it yesterday. Feeling good? ALL: Yes! Awesome. Right, for your next challenge, I want to see all of you running a business. OK. Because tomorrow, you're going to be selling street food from your very own shacks on the beach. ALL: Woo! But listen carefully. Now, I want you all to be ambitious... ..creative... ..shine as individuals, but come together as a team. Right, teams... Bola, Asher, Vincenzo and Leah, you are the red team. OK, Michelle, Jen, Amit and Steph... What a team. Yes! ..you are the green team. This is the one. Yes. And clearly, Matthew, Valentina, Jamie and Victoria, you are the blue team. We're the winning one. Now, this challenge is very simple. The team that makes the most profit... ..wins. Got it? ALL: Yes. Got it. Right, off you go. Get cracking. Good luck. Let's go! Let's go. I love our team! I'm setting this challenge because I want to see how they run a business. And I'm testing how they work as a team. It may sound simple, running a food shack on the beach, but trust me... ..it isn't. Before they get started, I've sent them to see what some of the top street food sellers here in Cornwall have to offer. They've got Mexican, pizza... Oh, there's a curry. Morning. Good morning! Morning. The guys here have successfully combined locally sourced food with the finesse of top chefs. What would you say is the favourite meal for locals here? We sell chicken tikka kebabs for days. What's the Cornish element that you bring? The bacon jam that we've got on here. Bacon jam? Yeah, so that's what's going to go on the burgers. Oh, my gosh, that's amazing. What are people after? The vegan and vegetarian market is growing really fast. In less than 24 hours, the teams will be selling their food from the beach. So, first job, they really need to suss each other out. I have a cafe and a bakery, and I'm vegan, so obviously, you know, I'm going to make sure we've got some really yummy vegan options. I've worked at Street Food Fest in London, so I know what attracts people. I went from making plantain crisps on my own in my mum's kitchen and selling them door-to-door on doorsteps to being in a major supermarket. So with Gordon Ramsay's funding, I will skyrocket. My business started from trading on street stalls. I also taught food to adults in a cookery school. That's wonderful. I can cook. I have experience in seafood and market stall. My business is about producing artisan smoked salmon. I am really excited about what I do. When you have ambition and passion, there's nothing that can stop you. I've done a lot of management in the Navy, so I can get everyone's best qualities together. Yeah. I run a street food kitchen. I run my own pub. So we might have found our chef. I run the best foodie joint in the whole of Malvern. We have customers coming from everywhere. When it comes to true Indian food, I might just be the best. I'm completely gravitating towards the Indian food angle, guys. I don't think Indian food in Cornwall is going to be the right food. No, no. If I'm out there surfing or jumping off 40 foot cliffs, I'm not going to come back here for, like, loads of curry. I've got three very driven women working with me. Is it going to be challenging for me to get my point across? Not really. Toasted sandwiches. Toasted sandwiches! Toasted sandwiches do absolutely amazing at events. I think... And they're really...they're cheap to make. Everyone loves cheese, don't they? I am confident that is going to put us up there. I think we go tacos. We can make them uniform. We can make them fun. I love tacos. We can do.... Yeah, we can do that. Sounding good. Yeah. Awesome. I think we should go for a roll. Like a lobster roll? Like a lobster roll. I can't make it vegan, so let's pick something that I can make vegan, like arancini balls. I do not agree. It's going to take too long to cook. Can you just one second? Sorry... We need to look at the options around here. There's people doing burgers, there's people doing Mexican already. I think we should go for something like noodles. Noodles? Noodles. Fine. Yeah, noodles, sure. Let's do noodles. Yeah. Yeah. OK. You going to get behind it? I mean, I don't have any other choice, do I? No. When you are your own boss, it's really hard when someone else is telling you, \"No, let's do this,\" and you don't agree. That is definitely a challenge for me. Decisions made, now the teams must put them into action. I've set up three prep kitchens for them to devise their street food menus. Tomorrow, they'll be selling to the public from the beach below. Here is our kitchen. Where we're going to make the magic. Look at that. That looks all nice and shiny. This is actually good! Do you recognise what this stuff is, Amit? Yeah. Jamie. Oh, brilliant. Oh, hello, hello, hello. A proper kitchen. Yeah, I'm at home now. Right, guys, come over. Oh, hello. Hi! Line up over here. Right. I've sourced some of the best fish, meat, vegetables that Cornwall has to offer. Amazing. Here's the good news. Each team, you've all got \u00a3600... ALL: Wow! ..to spend on your ingredients. OK. Is that clear? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Good luck. Off you go. Let's go. Thank you. Let's do it. OK, what would go with cheese...? This challenge is all about understanding what sells... So you want a vegetarian option, a meat option. ..and then creating the most appealing menu. Chicken wings could be the side. Yeah, absolutely. But they'll need to be smart with their budget, as any money spent will be taken out of their profits. I'm happy to take control of the numbers because I've got a background in accounting and finance. Yeah. So if we're looking at chicken, then what's our second option? Bavette steak, I think we go with... You want to go chicken and steak? I... Well, it's a quicker cooking time. But do we want to do the things that everyone always have? We are in the seaside. Why would you go for meat? We are in Cornwall. We need to use some fish. Yeah. Monkfish is an option. It's incredible. I really want to do fish because it's definitely one of my biggest friends. We are in the seaside, so fish has to be a must. What are we thinking? Monkfish and chicken as our two main options. We're going to do tacos. Yeah. Monkfish, you don't really see in a taco that often, so that's a tough one to execute. The Red Team is going down the taco route, which is a smart move. They're very popular in this neck of the woods. My one worry is the monkfish. That is a very difficult fish to get right. We're going to agree with the scallops? Yeah. Yes. And the mushroom. Those mushrooms are amazing. On the Blue Team, vegan chef Valentina is eyeing up pricey mushrooms for her main. But we know they're expensive. Just because it's vegan, it doesn't mean that has to be cheap. Right, where we going? What's the ideas? We're going to have noodles, one served with scallops and one served with mushroom. So everybody on board with this? Did we all have an input? Yeah. I'm going to be on the money, so I'm looking at the financials. Good. So I'm making sure that we're... Play to your strengths. Right. Good luck. Thank you. Thank you. Cheers. We've got Cornish Yarg, which is like a Cheddar. On the Green Team, taking the lead with her toastie idea, Steph. So we're doing cheese toasties with mushrooms... Uh-huh. ..a plain toastie and a bacon toastie. Yeah. And then the side is mac and cheese with lobster. Yeah. I don't think the toastie thing's going to work... OK, it's too late now. We're sticking with what we got now. We've got cheese this, cheese toastie here, cheese toastie... They just sound boring. It's not, mate. Seriously... Lamb mince, we can just make little meatballs, we can spice them. You just need to listen because we have agreed it. Yeah. We've got a knockout thing. If we just press believe, and we'll go cheese toasties. Mm. Yeah. Right. You don't look very happy. What's wrong? We've got a little bit of conflict in the team. Conflict? Why conflict? They just want to do cheese toasties. They... OK... Hold on. Are you part of this team? Of course. I'm 100% part of the team. Girls, have you taken him out? No. No. We want him in. He's our chef. We need him. I just think we should be picking some of that fish and some of the lovely produce that we're able to use and play to my strengths. You lot said, OK... I'll leave you guys to sort it out. OK. Thank you. The Green Team, you know, they can absolutely make a fortune with those toasties here, but it doesn't feel like they're on the same page. Now, you've got a chef at the helm, Amit, that's not even in love with what he's executing, so they've got to come together as a team. Let's go. You sure you don't want to get some chicken and some minced lamb? No, please, Amit! Huh? Please. I've given the teams two hours to create sample dishes from their menus. I then want to taste what they're planning to offer on their food shacks tomorrow. In the kitchen it's very important to have someone in charge. And I think, yeah, I really trust you on that. OK. Yeah. I trust you on that as well. OK, good. Yeah. It's totally fine with me. I want to be head chef all the time. Yeah. Let's just get these floured so they're ready. Valentina, do you want me to start slicing mushrooms? Yeah, that'd be great. As Valentina preps her vegan main... Just this in half? Yes. Yeah. ..Victoria has had a chance to crunch the numbers. Valentina, the specialist mushrooms are really expensive. It's a profit task. I really think we should use the other mushrooms and change it. No, I disagree. I mean, Valentina, to be completely honest with you, how many people are going to buy a vegan dish? We use the mushrooms that are less expensive. Come on, it's a no-brainer. Why are we choosing specialist mushrooms in a vegan dish? Because it has to please everyone, not just the vegans. Can I make the decision? As you have put me responsible for financing... I haven't put you responsible in finance. I don't even want you to be responsible for finance. Well, I've put myself in the position of finance. We haven't done the order yet. I run a restaurant. I know how to price and do margin with food. OK. Right, let's look at this from... Let's look at this from a practical point of view. Can we...can we try with both? Ah, da-da-da-da. Valentina is very strong on what she wants to do, and if she's decided that she wants it and you disagree, you're enemy number one. Come on, now. Play nice. No, I won't. You're going to stop it now. No, I won't. Because... No, you are going to stop because this is not OK. I'm not even engaging with you. Well, you're going to have to cos we're working in a team. Come on... I just want her to shut up. I'm not going to shut up. You can't tell me to be quiet. I have to talk. Stay away. I don't want you any close to my face. Move. Come on. It's pathetic. Let's just get on with this. I'm furious. Can you not see it? You see it, yeah? I'm furious. She didn't even weigh them so she has no base to say that that is too expensive. OK. Asher, you want to push down on that chicken, get it really cooked. With Leah in charge... I want that to start to look a little bit more like that. Sounds good. ..cooking is well under way for the Red Team and their tacos. I love to, like, delegate. \"You do this, you do this, you do this.\" It's almost like my superpower. I'm not being too bossy, am I? Am I being too bossy? Go for it, girl. THEY LAUGH So we're called Toast Of The Town. Toast Of The Town. When did you lot decide the name? I literally just wrote it on this board. OK, I'll give you that. The name's not bad. On the Green Team, head chef Amit is rustling up an Asian inspired bacon chutney. I'm just going to do my thing now. Would I have loved to do many different things? Yes. But hey-ho, we'll get there. Oh, look at that cheese. Oh! It's fantastic. Oh, nice. Do we have a team effort going on now? We do. Yes. Yeah? We're over that. We're over that now. OK, how long before we can taste a toastie? We should have to ready in about ten minutes. Ten. Great. Looking forward to it. Ah! Before I get to taste the team's menus, I've arranged to meet up with a couple of young guys who have cooked up a storm in Cornwall's street food scene. A few years ago, Blaise and Robbie teamed up with four other friends. Calling themselves the Taco Boys, they became a street food phenomenon, serving Mexican inspired food with a high-end twist. I remember when I first met you guys. I'm off for a run early in the morning and I see this massive queue on the beach. I'm like, \"Damn, there's been an accident.\" And then I could smell this food, and there was this tiny shack with a 150-metre queue. Mm-hm. What do you think it was that made you stand out? We were trying to bring fine dining to the people. We all come from a fine dining background, and we felt the rest of the competition in that area in particular was very much flipping burgers. Just putting some of those fine dining processes into the elements. It made it so much better. I've asked the boys to come along to the beach tomorrow to give me some of their expert feedback on the teams' shacks. What advice would you give my lot tomorrow? Communication. Yeah. Teamwork. You may not like someone in that specific moment, but you have to work together. Can't wait to get your feedback. I can't wait to dig into this thing because the breakfast... Look at that thing. I mean, honestly, seriously. Quick question. Does that hair come with the hat? It's getting a bit urgent now. We need more kick. We need more spice. Back in the prep kitchen... More heat! Bring on the heat! It's time for me to sample what the teams will be serving tomorrow. OK. We have got one minute. First up, the Red Team. Got the monkfish almost ready. Do you want to put more paprika on it? No, not paprika... OK, he's coming. He's coming. He's coming. He's coming. Go, go, go, go, go. I should have actually tasted it. Oh! Love the colours. Bright, enthusiastic. Right, monkfish. Who cooked the monkfish? I did. I cured it with lime and then I cook at high heat. The actual monkfish is cooked nicely. Yeah. But there's hardly any monkfish. One tiny little slice. What's this one? Cajun chicken with a mango and lime sauce. Bit of chilli in there. Mm-hm. So that is way too hot. Those spices are absolutely obliterating everything. Have you all tasted this? Not yet. You shouldn't be giving me food that you haven't tasted. Right? And that there, that's paprika. SHE LAUGHS Yeah... I'm not laughing. Who put that on there? I did. Yeah, you won't eat that raw. I'm underwhelmed. I love the idea of the tacos. I think they'll fly on the beach. They need refining. Come on, get it together. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. We still have time to fix things. The Red Team, they're not even tasting what they're doing. How can you sell an amazing taco to customers when you haven't even tasted it yourself? That's basic stuff. I just don't want to let them down. I don't want it to be my fault that... ..we lose. I always cry. Next up... Oh, my God. ..is the Green Team. Toast Of The Town. Fingers crossed. Lead me through it. This is the plain toastie, which is the Yarg, the local cheese. Have you all tasted this? Yeah. Yes. Yes. Love it. We're confident. So that just tastes plain. The cheese is not even melted in that. What's the secret of a good toastie? ALL: Melted cheese. Melting the cheese. OK, what's this one? So this is the bacon chutney. That tastes nice. Does taste good, that one. Yeah. We're proud of that one. What price are we thinking? \u00a38 for those two. \u00a38 each? \u00a38. OK. So we're going to have an outcry and we'll all be banned from Cornwall if we charge \u00a38 for that. It's all about the execution now. Make sure it's the best fucking toastie tomorrow in Cornwall. I'm serious. Yes? Thank you. Thanks, Chef. Thank you. OK. Well, the bacon jam was an absolute success. Yes. Yeah, yeah. We've just got to pull it together. Chicken's done, I reckon, Jamie. My final tasting is with the Blue Team. Very salty. Chicken is, yeah, it's too much. Right, let's start off... Let's start from the top. What's this? This is our salt and pepper chicken wings. It's overseasoned, we know that. So you've overseasoned it and you know that. Yeah, that's... Yeah. They're a bit too salty. Right. I was half panicking and I just went... Popped it in. Holy fuck. Massive... Yeah, yeah. Like, literally, I was like, \"Fuck.\" Shit. Jesus Christ. I know, yeah. The saltiness on there is insane. Ridiculous, off the charts. You've just sunk your shack. LAUGHTER All jokes apart, that is inedible, right. Next dish? The noodles have been done with premium mushroom. The actual mushrooms taste nice. Really nice. Thank you. Just make sure they're cooked, cos inside they can taste spongy if they're not cooked. We've got one more dish for you to try, which is these mushrooms, so we're deciding whether to go for these ones or... These are more expensive ones. I would like to use this because they're better quality, they're local produce. I mean, I'm open to... I can't do the challenge for you. You have to adjust in terms of where you use those mushrooms. And be smart. OK. Definitely, yeah. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thanks a lot. Cheers. Man... Tomorrow, when we have got people in front of us, we cannot have any of this attitude. When it happens, you ignore it and then you walk away. Yeah, that's it. Last job of the day, the teams have to put in their final orders for ingredients. How much are the mushrooms? So you've got a minimum order quantity of 20. It's \u00a3100. I think putting those mushrooms in there, we shoot ourselves in the foot. But still do a vegan option with the other mushrooms. Yeah. We need to win this. OK, perfect. I knew that I was going to have some problem because I'm a character. Of course, there's going to be a clash. But I didn't quite envision it quite as soon as now. So I'm a little bit worried because I don't know what's going to happen tomorrow. Did you do the chilli? Chilli flakes. Then we've got the Yarg. Tomorrow, as long as we're organised, we know exactly what we're doing. When that money starts rolling in, which it's going to do, we are going to be absolutely happy. Big day tomorrow. Yeah. Don't forget... Tensions are running high at the moment cos we all want the win. We all know that someone's going home and so I don't want the fear to get the better of us. Here we go. Oh, my God, this is where I'm doing my magic! 11am. Look at this! I've given the teams an hour to prep their food and get their shacks ready... That's a lot of work. ..before they open to a beach full of hungry paying customers. Come on, then, guys. We better get started. If the teams get it right today, they could turn a healthy profit. Ah! Get it wrong, and for one person in the losing team, it could be the end of the line. So let's just sort out who's going to do what. The teams will need to be organised and efficient if they're going to be ready in time. I need to really get cracking with the bacon. Of course. You've got to get bacon on. Yeah. I'm doing the cheese sauce. I'm going to be serving customers, reeling them in, taking their orders. And I'm going to be stood on the grill, making the cheeses. I want to run this like a military operation. I'm in charge. Amit's a great chef. He's doing a good job as head chef, but ultimately the running of that stall is on me. Let's get the jam off there and get it clean. Yeah. Oh, smell that bacon. I think a kitchen, to work, needs a leader, and I think that Jamie is the best person to do that. I'm taking that. Right, let's go. Let's go. All right. Gordon spitting out my food yesterday was an absolute nightmare. But I know what I did wrong, anyway, so today we'll absolutely smash it. Gordon said that we need to come together as a team today. He picked up on a bit of tension that was happening yesterday. It's stressful. It's a stressful thing we're doing. But I think if we just keep focused today, we'll do it. The problems I had with Victoria yesterday, they still remain. It's not that they disappeared, but it's not about me and her. It's about the team and not silly stuff. Touch them like...like you love them, you know, like you're giving a massage to someone you love. VICTORIA LAUGHS It's true! I think I'm not strong enough to cut the corn. I think everyone on the team is frantic, maybe a little bit all over the place, but trying to keep it cool. Whoa! Oh, shit! Oh... Well, yeah. Calm down. We've still got some mango left. Ah! Bola? Yeah? Shall we do a lighter dressing, then, and make it hotter? Leah, what do you think? I've stopped thinking. OK. Leah was the lead in the kitchen yesterday, has then taken more of a backseat now. There's not enough clarity at the moment in terms of what people are doing, which I'm a bit nervous about. I can't do it. There's too much to do. It's nearly lunchtime... I'm not sure we've got enough coleslaw. ..and before the first customers start to arrive, I want to check in on the teams. Toast Of The Town, how are we feeling? AMIT: Good, Gordon. We're good? Yeah. Any adjustments to yesterday? Yes. Yeah. We sliced the bread slightly thick so people feel like they're getting a good deal. Got you. What's the pick up time executing at? Three to four minutes. Good. So stay front of those, OK? Yeah. Don't get that queue too long. Yeah. OK. Good luck. Oh, my God, people are starting to arrive, guys! Mayday, Mayday! Dear, dear. My sweet Jesus. OK, how are we feeling? Good. Yeah? Good, smells good. For me, yesterday, slightly fragmented. We're together. We've worked well as a team today. We're together. I'm not asking you to be best mates. No. No. They come here to have a good time, not to see us fighting, so, you know... Trust me. Yes. Get serious and sell, sell, sell. Remember. Good luck. Thank you, Gordon. Oh, my God, I need to pick up the pace. Right, how are we doing? Are you guys going to be ready? Yes. Yes. Yeah. It's all about the prep at the moment. It's all about assembly. But that beach is packed. Yeah. Yeah? And...there's nothing on here. I'm doing it now. Where's the pen? Oh, it's there. Let's go. OK, guys, it's crunch time now. We've literally got about five minutes. Let's go. Can we do one practice run with me doing it...? No. We're here now. This is it. How many sandwiches have we got? We've got enough for about 100. It's starting to feel like we need 200. We're not clear on who's doing what. Can we try to mix things up? With only minutes left to open, a last-minute change for the Red Team. I can serve. Yeah? Leah is going to be doing the final touch and then Bola's going to take care of the fish. So who's doing the sides, then? It's suddenly changed positions as to who's going to be working on what, and I'm quite surprised at that, considering how passionate Vincenzo was about the monkfish, that he's now putting that on Bola. I'm going to try to stay on top of it. But, yeah, bear with me. OK, we're ready. Come on, get your cheese toasties, folks! Midday, and the team shacks open to the public. They've got three hours to make as much profit as they can. Hi, folks. Can I get a Yarg cheese toastie, please? Yes, you can. Yarg cheese toastie, first order! So what do you fancy? Bacon toastie. Three Yarg toasties. Three of the bacon toasties. Cheese toastie. Pop it in. Hang on. It's not ready yet. What can I get you? They need to keep on top of their orders... Oh, good choice. Where are you going? This way. This is the right line. ..deliver food quickly... Once chicken, one mushrooms, one scallops. We've got two chicken wings. Enjoy! ..whilst making sure it's cooked to perfection. Can we get five monkfish tacos, please? Of course you can. And I'm so happy because the monkfish was the product I decided to have, so I'm so glad you're excited to have it. Come on. Bola, have you ever cooked monkfish before? Never. This is new for me. That's still raw. It's just not getting hot. We'll have two of the monkfish. Sure. I was so happy with your order cos the fish was my preparation. How are we doing with the fish? It's taking its time to cook. I'm really disappointed in Vincenzo, who said he was so confident in the monkfish. If I was backing something that much, I'd have stayed till the very end. I don't want to overhear him saying to customers, \"I'm really pleased that you picked that because that was my choice.\" I'm so happy you're going for the fish, cos that was my decision of using the monkfish. I just think it's utter bollocks, to be honest. We've got one combo chicken. We want one watermelon, one corn... Vincenzo? Yeah? I thought you were doing the monkfish this morning. Yeah, I did the preparation and then... So I've been cooking the monkfish. Have you cooked monkfish before? No, but I put myself out to do anything that needs to be done. Why aren't you owning your monkfish? Why Bola? Bola doesn't know to cook monkfish. Because I wanted to be here and help the customers. Leah. Yeah? We OK? Yeah. Remember, the essence of this is teamwork. Yeah. Yeah? Teamwork, teamwork. Hey, how are you? Man, it's like headless chickens. Mid-service, and it's time for me to deploy my secret shoppers... Hello! ..the Taco Boys. Can I get the bacon chutney and the mac and cheese as well, please? The first port of call is the Green Team. They're just coming. Cheese toastie! Oh, there you are. Woo! So we're running about ten minutes, if that's OK. That's cool. We'll shout your number when you're ready. Is that all right? Sounds good. Thank you so much. Right, two more cheese. I need a cheese and I need a bacon. Get me some bacon now. Right, you've got people waiting. Sorry, folks. I wish you weren't waiting so long. That's nice. That's melted. That's good to go. How much more do you want to melt that? I'm not selling an undercooked toastie. I've been waiting for about 20 minutes so far. As the backlog continues to build, I want to find out if Robbie and Blaise think the toasties are worth the wait. How was that? The food, I think, could have been cooked a lot better, especially when you're doing something as simple as toasties. I couldn't taste any truffle in the mushroom toastie. We were really keen to try out the asparagus, but they just didn't serve us that part of the order. So you ordered it, but you didn't get it? Didn't get it. Yeah. Sorry to keep you waiting, sir. I love vegans! Any vegans? Any vegan people? She's a vegan, if you didn't realise. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. The next shack I want them to check in on... What do you fancy? ..is the Blue Team. I fancy trying the tempura mushroom. Yeah, I'll go...I'll go scallops, please. Scallops. Do you fancy some chicken wings to share, as well? Yeah. Blue Team, what did you think? So the noodles were a little bit stodgy with, like, a load of things kind of thrown on top. Scallops were good, though. I think it's a good choice, it's local produce. Did they seem on the same page as a team? Yeah. Everyone had a set role and they were communicating. Their sections were clean. They were quite, you know, happy in their roles. Good. Last shack for Robbie and Blaise... Fuck's sake. Ash, you need to tidy up that area. Yeah. ..is the Red Team. One fish, one chicken and a side of the watermelon, please. Guys, can we please have two fish, two chicken, one watermelon? If you can just please wait on the side, we'll serve you the food as soon as it's ready. Perfect. What's the next order? It was, yeah. Can you throw on the floor whatever we don't need? OK, now I don't know what I'm doing. The Red Team. How was that? The whole team, when we were being served, didn't seem to know what was going on. Everyone had a very messy section. So we had chicken and a monkfish? It was the same taco each time, just a different protein, and then a dollop of pineapple on top. It felt lazy. If I can't trust that you're going to work clean and provide me with a good food, then why would I buy from you again? Having you both here today, unbeknown to them, has been a big advantage for me. Continued success. Thank you so much. Thank you so much. Safe trip back. Appreciate it. Thank you so much. Take care, guys. What's my next toastie? Anybody 26? Lunch is in full swing... Is anybody 26? ..but not everyone has had their food. We're now giving them 40 minutes to wait. That's what we're telling them when they're ordering, basically. I think people have been waiting so long, they've gone somewhere else. Yeah, 26 has gone. So we've been waiting for an hour. OK, just give me three minutes. I'm on it. OK? Right, how are we? We're just about holding it together. What do you mean, just about holding it together? How long are the customers waiting? So we're advising them 30 to 40 minutes at the moment. But it's a toastie. Yeah. Get some pans on, nonstick pans on there, and just try and speed that up. No-one's going to wait 40... What you're going to end up doing is actually losing customers. They'll go further down there. Unbelievable. 40 minutes for a fucking toastie. Are you kidding me? Right, folks. I'm going to stop serving. We need to get caught up. Get your own ticket and get on with it. I cannot take money off people without getting the orders out. If the Green Team don't tackle their backlog of orders, they may have to issue refunds to their customers... Two scallops, two mushrooms? Two of each. Two of each! Let's go wild, yeah? ..which can also happen if supplies run out. It looks like we're running a bit low on the noodles. Have we got some more? I don't think so. Mate... No. No? We needed to keep an eye on fucking how much noodles we've got. Don't have noodles. Oh, fuck. You should have... Oh, man. OK, it's fine. Guys... It's not. It's not. It's not. I know it's not OK. I know... It's not OK. Those things happen, though. If we keep taking orders... Yeah. ..and we've not got the food, there's no fucking point, is there? I'm actually going to refund you the \u00a39 for the mushrooms, OK? Okey-dokey. Right, we're ending on a low here, aren't we? While the Blue Team have ground to a halt... Look at all that monkfish. ..the Red Team have a load of stock still to shift. Can we give the fish a discount? Yeah. Yeah? Yeah. Can we do \u00a34? Yeah. Last orders, get your orders in. Come and get you cheese toasties while they last. This challenge is based solely on profit... \u00a35 toasties! ..and with lunch drawing to a close, one final push for sales. Last orders! We've got loads and loads of veg here. Loads and loads. Offer it without the noodles, just stir fried veg. We've got one minute. Come on! Monkfish tacos! Come on! Yes! And station is closed. Oh! Oh, that was horrible. God, I'm, like, broken right now. Are you OK? You just look like you're in a bad mood. I was surprised how long the monkfish took to cook. The teams have done everything they can. We had to do that refund at the end, but we just don't know how well they've done. Yeah. It's fascinating, watching those teams work together for the first time. Each shack had their ups and downs, but it's all about the figures. Tomorrow, they'll meet me in London and I'll reveal the results. INDISTINCT CONVERSATION Right. That was a busy few days. How are we all feeling? Yeah. Good. Yeah, good. Now, at the start of the week, I got you all to jump off a cliff. Yeah. That, for me, was a great test of character because I wanted to see how all of you reacted under pressure. And that is what this whole process is about. So let's talk about the food challenge, shall we, on the beach? Yes. Yes. Blue Team. Jamie, Valentina, Matthew and Victoria. What I saw on day one was an absolute bloody disaster. Yeah, it was. Arguing. Yeah. Yeah. Slow to make decisions. It was embarrassing on day one. What happened? Well, first of all, we don't know each other, so we never worked together. Guys, I said to you from day one, shine as individuals, stand out as a team. You don't need to like everybody you work with, but you do need to get on. Right, Red Team. Bola, Asher, Vincenzo and Leah. Tacos on the beach. On the prep day, Leah, you took control. Yes. Right. Good leadership? Yes. Yeah. Now, on the big day, when I turned up before we opened, you hadn't even written out on your board what you were selling. Who was in charge then? Because, Leah, that wasn't you, was it? You handed the reins to Vincenzo. What happened? Um... I think when we realised people were about to come, we were a bit confused on who was going to do what. Let me stop you there. In business, you've got to be ready. If you're not ready, you get swallowed up. So just own it. You fell behind. Yeah. Right, Green Team. Steph, Michelle, Jen and Amit. Day two, opening of the shack. Listen, I'm not going to lie, guys. There were some long waits. 40 minutes for a toastie. We did get that back to 20 minutes. I could have gone to fucking Tesco's, bought my own fucking Breville toaster, come back within 40 minutes and made one there and then. And I think you missed out on prolific business... I agree. ..due to the lack of execution and not being thought out properly. Yeah. I felt there was no team dynamic. GORDON SIGHS OK. Time to reveal the results. The team that has made the most profit wins. It's as simple as that. One team ended up with a impressive profit... ..of \u00a3754.40. The winners this week are... ..the Blue Team. THEY CHEER Well done, guys! Fantastic, well done. Well done. Well done. Well done, well done. Well done. Yeah. Well done. Well done. Those bloody noodles won it. LAUGHTER On the prep day, you were a shambles. All over the place. Absolutely. On the selling day, it was a total 180. It was. You were in sync, you were efficient, and clearly, the customers loved your food. Well done. Thank you. Thank you. Seriously. Thank you very much. So it's now between the Red Team and the Green Team. Red Team, you took a profit of \u00a3391. Green Team, you spent the most of all teams on ingredients. I said from the get-go, \"Guys, we shouldn't be spending more than 300.\" Psst, you're two days too late. I know. LAUGHTER OK? You spent \u00a3500.40, but you did make good sales, and the profit across those sales was... ..\u00a3454.60. Which means the losing team are the Red Team... ..by about 60 quid. That is just ten tacos. Gutted. Absolutely gutted. That's it. Yeah. So, sadly, someone in your team will be leaving tonight. But before I decide who that is, I want to give you a chance to explain yourselves. I want to grill you one on one about your performance. I'll see you in the restaurant. Ugh. Pff. Ten tacos short is ringing in my ears. Ten...ten tacos. It hurts. I think we lost because everybody really wanted to shine, but lost sight of what it was all about. It's a nerve-racking experience to be thinking about being grilled by Gordon. But I feel like I've tried to do enough this week to justify my place in this competition. I knew we didn't do well. Um, I felt it. Right now, the only thing I want to do is to be right in front of Gordon and prove him, I'm the right person to stay in this process. Sit down, please, Asher. Thank you, Gordon. Hi, Bola. Hi, Gordon. VINCENZO: Hi again, Gordon. Please take a seat. Time to catch up properly, just you and I. Yeah. Right, Asher, could you see things going wrong over those two days? I was critiquing doing the monkfish tacos. I felt that we should have gone for sirloin steak tacos, so we could be really quick when cooking everything, getting it out as hot as possible. And I should have stuck with my guns at the very beginning and pushed... Absolutely right. So why didn't you? That's the bit I need to understand. Because I wanted to be maybe the nice guy to other people and support them. If you can't get three people standing alongside you in a shack to listen to you, how are you going to make your business global? Leah, day one looked good. Strong, confident. Yeah, I know. There was a sense that I was running the show. I felt like maybe I was taking too much control, and I also wanted to give other people an opportunity. If you control the day before... I know. ..so well... Yeah. ..how do you expect it to run to perfection with no leader at the helm? But why did I have to be the leader on the first day and the second day? But I couldn't... Because your team needed one. OK. Vincenzo, you got so excited with that monkfish taco. You said to me and to your team that you're going to make this the best taco in Cornwall. Come the big day... Yeah. ..you off-loaded that responsibility to Bola. It was not an off-loading. When we got to serving clients, there was a missing leader. I felt there was no-one who was willing to take a step to say, \"You go there, you go there.\" So, I had two options - either flipping fish and letting my team work with no leaders, or I could step up. I know my skills, and I know that selling and being in front of clients were my skills. You promised to propel that dish to the winning dish. You conceptualised that. That was your idea. You were the last person on Earth that I expected to see running that window. Have you ever cooked a monkfish before? I haven't, but I'm quite confident with my cooking skills. Why would you take that role of a dish you've got no idea how to execute it? Why would you put yourself on the chopping block? I had to pick it up because, without me, nothing would have been done. I took on board quite a bit more than I should have. If I wasn't on that team, it would have fallen apart. It did fall apart! Unbeknown to you, I had two street-food phenomenons secretly tasting all of your food, and this was their opinion of your shack. OK. \"Messy kitchen, disorganised service, \"slow execution.\" Oh. That is shocking. I expect a better performance. Sure. Yeah, I expected better, too. Who's accountable? Yeah. Who dropped the ball? Yeah. What let us down was we had a lot of fish underneath the stall that we could have sold. Vincenzo was meant to be cooking, and I felt that he let that side of it down. I gave to Leah every single possibility to shine. She was not willing to take it. There was a sense of panic. I took control in that first day, but I'm not about to, like, start mothering them and controlling them the second day. In terms of the kitchen being messy, I kept telling everyone that I couldn't work that way, but others felt that that wasn't the most important thing. I need to see confidence, passion, delegation, and you stand by your convictions if you are to continue in this competition. What am I not seeing? I really deserve to be here, and I want to prove to you, every single week, that I am here, that I deserve my place in this competition. I'm going to make sure that I'm thinking quicker, thinking smarter. This was our big day to shine, and in future, I will be at my best and give my best, whatever the task. I see the way your business has taken off. I see the way that you are comfortable dealing with some very high-profile clients. I was expecting a much bigger leader on the big day in that shack. The leader in me did not shine. The person who you saw in the last days, it was a scared boy. The person who is sitting on this table now is a man hungry. Head back to the lounge. HE CLICKS HIS TONGUE HE SIGHS OK. That was intense. I've hand-picked all of you because you've got some of the best food and drink ideas anywhere in Great Britain today. And across every challenge, I need to see you stepping up. I'm not here for excuses. Yes, chef. I've made a decision. It's been a tough one, but I've got to go with my own instinct. The person that I will not be investing in... ..d will be leaving tonight... ..is Vincenzo. Oh! Oh, man. Vincenzo, the fact that you already have a successful business is a testament to you and your ambition. But I'm sorry... ..we're done. SIGHING I had to let Vincenzo go, because, in business, you need to put your strongest people in their strongest positions. He did the opposite. He created something, and then he dropped the ball. You OK, yeah? We were very close, and if we could have sold just a few more tacos, I wouldn't be in this position. HE MURMURS INDISTINCTLY So, it was just a combination of silly things that made this happen. I'm just going to take it as a drive to do even better in my business. I'm going to go home and feel even more motivated than I was before. Next challenge, I'm going to be tougher, make sure that my voice is heard, and I'm going to show that I totally deserve my place here. I'm gutted for Vincenzo, but I never want to be in this position ever again. It's...it's brutal. I didn't know how much I wanted it until I sat opposite Gordon. I'm on fire now. So, next week, same time next week. Next time, it's back to basics, testing raw skills... Oh, what do I know about fish? ..laying on a feast in the forest... Festival! We can't serve honey to vegans. Oh, don't speak to me like a child. You couldn't organise a piss-up in a brewery. ..and someone is heading home. Disorganised, underprepared. You let your team down. Hi, guys, it's Gordon. Now do you have what it takes to be my future food star and win my substantial investments? Now, if you have a great business and the passion to succeed, then please get in touch for Series Two at... Good luck. "}

Revolutionary. Power to the people! Hilarious. THEY SQUEAL And poignant. Here's to my wonderful family. Yeah. There will be no next season for The Fresh Prince Of Bel-Air. The final episode of The Fresh Prince Of Bel-Air airs tonight on NBC. What a great run for that show. Sure was. Mm, six years. You know, Will... ..this is the last time we'll ever live together. FRESH PRINCE THEME ON PIANO Five seconds. Four, three, two... The house feels so empty. It's kind of creepy. Well, it's a part of us. These walls have heard our laughter and our tears. Leaving is like leaving a grand, old friend. FRESH PRINCE INTRO PLAYS THEME MUFFLES THEME ECHOES Hey! Wow, Daphne, come here! THEY LAUGH THEY LAUGH Well, well, well! Man! Oh, man!

HE GASPS You know? And you just don't... You don't realise how much life gets spent at work. Yeah. And it's just a beautiful thing for us that this turned into a real family and not work. Right. You know? We were all from different parts of the world and the camaraderie was just immediate. I immediately felt comfortable and at home. It was such a fast family. You know, you have fast friendships? We had a really fast family. We have some problems, but what family doesn't? All I know is when I need these people, they are right there for me. Of all the new TV shows slated for this fall, the one drawing the most favourable attention is called The Fresh Prince Of Bel-Air. I have a TV show coming out. Uh-huh. It's, you know, like, the Fresh Prince. You know, that's my nickname - the Fresh Prince. The Fresh Prince? Yeah. Oh, I read about you somewhere. Really? Yeah. What do you guys remember about the pilot? What are your memories? I remember... SHE LAUGHS Uh-oh. Hey, don't be looking like you're about to tell my business. I'm about to. HE LAUGHS I remember the pilot. I was beyond nervous, I was so scared, I was praying for an earthquake... Earthquake! THEY LAUGH Wow. Praying for an earthquake?! I was so scared! Were we going to be safe in the...? It didn't matter! It didn't matter! I came out. I'm saying my stuff, I'm trying to get through it, and just do my thing and keep it together and you mouthed... Oh! ..lines back to me for the first time. All rehearsal you never did it. OK. All rehearsal you never did it. The night in front of the audience, you looked up at me and went... And I would just be going... You did it to me. He said my lines to me! I did it to you! And I was a nervous wreck and I was like, \"Oh, my God!\" So wait, so my side of that was when we were on the set of the pilot, that was my first time like really doing dialogue. So you did everybody's dialogue? I learned everybody's. So it's on the episode, you can see it. Oh, yeah, you can see it, you can see it. I saw one episode, though, where you're standing, like, behind the couch in the living room scene. Yeah. And it's you and whoever else. Was that Don Cheadle? Tray! Fresh! Huh, huh! They literally had to show me and I was like, \"Oh!\" That's the one that was like, \"OK, we need to change this.\" You don't go to school, Tray? Oh, sure I do. I've been held back in the tenth grade three times in a row. Three times? Yeah, see my motto is when I find a grade I like, I stick with it. ON LAPTOP: I stick with it. That's terrible! That's terrible! Oh, wow! Oh, that's painful to watch! She was so ugly that Freddy Krueger used to have nightmares about her. Was it the fifth episode when you finally had enough? And you were like... Cos I remember in rehearsal, she just looked and she said, \"Stop it!\" I knew everybody's lines. I would have played Uncle Phil, I could have played Aunt Viv. I knew everybody's words. Does anybody remember their audition? I mean, I remember very little of it, obviously, but, like, I do remember... Oh, no! Oh! SHE SQUEALS Alfonso Ribeiro. You're ten! You're ten! OK. WILL SQUEALS OK. What am I wearing?! What have you been doing in here? Just maxing and relaxing. I meant what have you been doing to this room? Keep on trying to make it a little more human. Malcolm X, he's my hero. Well, he was a great man. I don't know if I'd call him my hero exactly. Whoa! What a snob! Wow. First, I will say... No, we're going to give that a moment of silence. OK, yes. I know I didn't go there wearing a sweatsuit believing that I was going to get that character. I don't know what I was thinking. I don't know how I got that job! That dude sucked! Oh! No! You are so much fun to watch. Thank goodness. With everything you do. I guess somewhere along the line people were able to see the magic that I clearly couldn't see. Do you remember your audition? They had me audition in New York and I remember my mom and my aunties being really excited because I was auditioning for Quincy Jones. That was my second call, and they had me rap. But they had the kids, like last minute, make up a rap. Like, I can sing, I can't rap. Like, that's a whole other skill set. RAPS: # Hey there, Lord, my name is Ashley Banks # My family and friends want to give you some thanks # So before this dinner's all swallowed and chewed # Thank you, God, for this stupid food! # And I guess I was probably so corny and so bad that that's what... \"That's perfect!\" I remember thinking like, \"This is really horrible.\" Do you remember your audition? Don't... No, I'm just... I'm just asking! SHE SQUEALS Karyn Parsons. Lord have mercy on me! Oh, my goodness! Dad, I need $300. Hilary, your cousin Will's here. Hi. Dad, I need $300. Like, I'm going on a Save The Ozone celebrity bus next Saturday and it's going to be Bruce Willis and Demi and Rob Lowe and, um... ..Emilio Estevez or Charlie Sheen, I don't remember which. Wow! That's beautiful. I auditioned a lot. I auditioned a lot. And I remember the network one because it was down to... There were like two Hilarys and I was so nervous and I caught my reflection in something and I remember I kind of started primping... And it was like I started feeling her, she started coming over me. Like, \"You got it, you got the role!\" No, but you could absolutely see the Hilary... That was Hilary. ..come to life, even as little as the way you held your bottom jaw. Yeah. Yeah. Right? It was so, just like... Huh! I'm in a bad mood and somebody is going to suffer. I didn't go to the audition in 1990 because they said, \"Oh, we want you to audition for this new sitcom with a rapper.\" I said, \"Mm, pass.\" I said, \"Oh, no thank you. No, no.\" And I left and I watched the show come on in September. I said, \"Oh, damn, that's cute.\" RAPS: Got this whole town of Bel-Air buzzin'. Get a load of me and my rapping cousin! Yeah, in the house! So Quincy Jones basically steam-rolled me through the whole process without ever really auditioning me, right? So the only kind of audition I had was Quincy's birthday. The show was an idea. Benny Medina had pitched me the idea and I was like, I was making music and they were like, \"Come to Quincy's house, \"we have this idea for a TV show.\" I'm like, \"OK.\" You know? \"I'll go to Quincy's!\" I'll go to Quincy's. So I go to Quincy's house and Benny Medina pitched me the whole idea of the show and he's like, \"You know, we have this idea.\" Cos it was based on Benny Medina's life. His life, right. He went from Watts to Beverly Hills. So I'm cool. So we go to Quincy's house and Benny's like, \"Hey, you know, this is the Fresh Prince.\" Quincy's like, \"I know who that boy is. I seen his stuff. \"Hey, come on in, come on in.\" So Quincy, it's his birthday, he had been tasting a little bit, right? So he was wetting his beak. He wet his beak, right? So he said, \"Come on in.\" So we go on in, and he says, \"Where you from?\" I said, \"I'm from Philly.\" He said, \"Your character's from Philly.\" I'm like, \"OK. \"Give me a glass of whatever Quincy's drinking.\" So it's like Quincy's birthday so it's a big party so everybody's in there. So it was Brandon Tartikoff, who's the head of NBC, Warren Littlefield, all that. So everybody gets in the room and Quincy says, \"Hey, clear the living room out, clear the living room out. We're going to do an audition.\" Oh, man! You're like, \"Of who? Of who?\" \"Who?\" \"Who's doing an audition?\" And he was like, \"Yeah, you got it, you got it, you got it.\" I say, \"Q, Q... No, no.\" And he grabs me and he takes me in the other room and he sits me down in his office. And there's a $48-million Thriller thing, there's The Color Purple, and he sits me under this... 70 Grammies! You know? And I'm sitting under all of that stuff and Michael's looking down on me like... So Quincy says, \"OK, what do you need?\" And I say, \"Quincy, I don't... I'm not an actor. I just...\" \"Just give me two weeks, let me find an acting coach \"and let me work on it \"and then let's just set up a proper audition.\" \"Oh, so two weeks. You only need two weeks?\" I said, \"Yeah, yeah, just two weeks.\" He said, \"So here's the deal. \"Right now, everybody that needs to say yes for this show \"is sitting out in that living room right now waiting for you.\" \"It's now!\" And I was like... I was like, \"Give me ten minutes.\" And he's like, \"All right! Audition in ten minutes! \"Audition in ten minutes!\" Far out! They did a deal memo that night. That's how we got to the pilot that fast. Holy cow! Whoa! How is it possible I've known you this long and never heard that story? I know, right? Do you remember, we were on tour? We were in Detroit. We were on tour and had a day off. Yeah. And Will flew... To go do The Arsenio Hall Show. ..and came back and said, \"I got a TV show.\" Being from Philly, \"I got a TV show\" was a homeboy with a camcorder. No-one thought anything other than that. It was probably six weeks later we were on the set, right? Wow! OK, Will, just come down stage a little. OK, actually, no, you're fine. And go. I remember our first table reading. Will and Alfonso were chasing each other around the table. There were network executives and all kinds of things, you know, really powerful people, and they were just playmates from the very beginning. Look who's here, Will. Hey...! Who is he? One of the things I've always been able to recognise in my life is chemistry. Mm-hm. And that really came alive on the show, the comedic relationship that we were able to develop. The initial focus of the show was going to be Will-Uncle Phil collisions. Oh, my God! We started to see the dynamics between the other characters. And Uncle Phil, Aunt Viv were holding the base and Will and Carlton being able to run wild. Yo, how you playing me, Prince? What? Yo, you dissin' me! Come on, man, stop it! It became clear very quickly that that was the most powerful comedic asset of the show. MUSIC: Apache by The Sugarhill Gang LAUGHTER # Tonto, jump on it, jump on it, jump on it... # We understood that someone had to be the straight man... Yeah, absolutely.. ..with the other person's silliness and comedy. It was never as crystal-clear as \"This is a Carlton moment\" or \"This is a Will moment\". It was always the show that came first. I saved your life. You owe me! We knew that we could rely on each other. And there was always a respect and a trust. POLICE SIREN BLARES Is that the police? Punch it, man! We in a Benz! Are you crazy? I call this a lucky break. A policeman is our pal. We can ask him for directions. The episode where Will and Carlton get pulled over made it abundantly clear that Will came from the streets, Carlton grew up in Bel Air... Listen to me, Carlton. When he comes up, keep your hands on the wheel. Good evening, officer. Carlton Banks. Keep your hands on the wheel. LAUGHTER Culturally, we learned how to see other people's points of view. Even when you make fun of me... ..I know you're doing it out of love. Influences change people. Will learned from Carlton, Carlton learned from Will. You can't be the same kid before Will comes into that house and be the same kid six years later. Admit it, Will. You care about me. I do not! You love me. LAUGHTER Hey, my brother, you want to take this outside?! Hey, why don't you do the Carlton dance? Real quick, do the Carlton dance! How about I don't and say I did? I never, ever could do the Carlton dance. For whatever reason, I can't find... There's an opposite thing that he does that I can't... I just never... I never was able to get it. The first time, all it said in the script was \"Carlton dances,\" and I needed to figure out how this character would dance. What would be the actual move that hit it perfect? You got to do it. One last time for me, man. MUSIC: It's Not Unusual by Tom Jones That final moment, doing it together, that was like Will finally making the full acceptance of Carlton. And we are in sync and as one. # It's not unusual to see me cry # I wanna die... # We did six seasons and 150 episodes, so that's like... Finding my favourite moment is really hard. This is a job for Sherlock Homeboy. My favourite episode is... ..Def Poets Society. Ladies and gentlemen, Mr Raphael de la Ghetto! APPLAUSE, LAUGHTER The Raphael de la Ghetto was fun for Joe to break character. Cannon to the right of them... Cannons to the left of them! Cannons in front of them! Volleyed and thundered! Talk about ham acting! That's brilliant. One of my most memorable moments was in the first season, when you guys blackmailed Hilary. I was really worried about how people were going to feel about Hilary all the time. I'm like, \"They're just going to hate her, \"they're going to hate her,\" which was true, and I found out just how much in that episode. That's awful! Is he making you clean his room? No. Will you clean mine? LAUGHTER Do you remember the audience? The audience, yes. They started stomping out there! UPROARIOUS LAUGHTER Hilary! A lot of sitcoms just had the \"Ha-ha-ha-ha!\" You know, they have the laugh knob that they would turn up. And there were moments on the show where we had to dial the laughter back. TREVOR: Hilary Banks! Oh, yes, Trevor! Will you marry me? THUD, LAUGHTER The Trevor moment was another one of those... Yes. One of those sustained laughs. CONTINUOUS LAUGHTER I ain't no bungee expert or nothing, but I don't think he's supposed to be slamming into the ground like that! I had my first kiss on the show. Like, my first actual kiss. I think I'd feel better if I could kiss you. AUDIENCE SQUEALS I was so nervous, and we're about to do the scene... Is it terrible that I want to kiss you back? ..and I swear to you, I see Alfonso, Will and Karyn peek out from behind the camera, like, \"Oooh!\" Can I blow in your ear? LAUGHTER That was all so... Like, I was 11, having, like, a breakdown. Like, \"I don't know what I'm doing. I don't know how to do this.\" Because everything... ROBOTICALLY: \"I don't know how to do...\" You got to act like you've got this tic, right? Like the army did this experiment on you, right, that just went terribly wrong. You got to be like, \"Back up! Back up!\" Mind your business, that's all. Mind your business. Back up! Back up! Mind your business, that's all, just mind your business. Me getting tossed out was written into the very first show that I did. When it aired, everybody loved it. When do we eat, here? We ate here later. You eat here never. Looks like you eat here often! LAUGHTER Argh! One day, we filmed maybe about... ..150 takes of me getting tossed out of the house. Argh! Argh! Argh! I think they didn't want to torture me any more, so that's the reason why they started using the same shot, and then that became a thing. Every time I walked into a scene and I had that shirt on, the audience kind of knew what was coming up. You know the drill. Uh-oh! Argh! Argh! My favourite moment, I think... I have so many things but the one that comes to my mind right away as the favourite is when you lost your mind and dragged yourself across that floor. Oh, my goodness. The whole set. That's my favourite scene. And into the... That was, I think... I've never laughed that hard in my life. Oh, God, she's still up there! Oh, my God! I don't know what you were doing. What got into you? So, so... But like, what... How do you know how to do that? There's a lot of things that I do that I don't know how I do! Oh, God! No! No! The scene was set up perfectly for it and I was like, let's just break the fourth wall and go absolutely crazy. Never before had those moments... Be allowed to be... ..be allowed to be on TV. That was a serious no-no. You don't break the fourth wall in sitcom television. That breaking of the fourth wall with the audience, that's a really special part of that connection that we had... Yeah. ..with the audience. Look at me when I'm talking to you! LAUGHTER Run! There's something different about you. We so rich! Why we can't afford no ceiling? That was cute. Like, that, that relationship with the audience, it was like, they were in on the joke with us. I always felt like the audience appreciated being let in. Yeah. Right, \"You're watching this and it's written,\" wink, wink! And while we're on the subject... That's kind of fly, right? Don't you wish you lived on TV? When we were doing the show, I always felt like it was just us and the audience that was present. I had no sense of millions of viewers beyond that, let alone decades and generations after that. I just want to sit here and watch a little TV. It was three shows. It was Monday Night Football, it was Monday Night Movie, and The Fresh Prince Of Bel-Air. People would leave Monday Night Football, go over to that other channel, and watch The Fresh Prince Of Bel-Air. It's like a beautiful underdog position where you're not really expected to win. You're not going to beat Monday Night Football, but we enjoyed the rumble. Now it's on! People loved watching the show, which meant a lot, because they didn't have it on their phones. You had to actually watch it to see it, and then the next day you would have to read about it in the newspaper. I realised that this show was bigger than I could've ever expected when there were 80-year-old grandmothers that would come up to me and say, \"Jazz.\" That freaked me out because I didn't correlate that people were recognising you from the television show. One thing special to me about the show was we all had a really unique and distinct fashion sense. HE SCREAMS I didn't realise how much freedom we had when it came down to the clothes. We always wanted to have the hottest stuff on. You know, we were always trying to find what was the hottest new thing. It isn't as easy at it looks. This was a very impactful time in pop culture, where, you know, you wanted to be fly. It's a little something I put together. Jordan would send over the new Jordans six weeks before they were coming out. You don't realise... you're wearing a pair of Jordans, that this picture is circulated among sneakerheads for the past 30 years. Ah. That's what's wrong. What? You know, I think that The Fresh Prince Of Bel-Air is a bigger hit now than it was ever before. Yes, it's the cast, and the cast is fun to watch and all of that, but I think it's the idea of it as the part that, I think, translates to so many different places. For years, I've had people come up to me and say, \"This show was my favourite show, \"and now it's my son's favourite show.\" And I think The Fresh Prince Of Bel-Air had a lot of impact. The things that stuck out for me whenever I've thought of this show, erm, has always been our Tuesdays and Wednesdays run-throughs. The way the week would work, we'd come in on Monday. Everybody's there, writers, producers, director, everybody, and we read the screenplay. Why don't you, Mom? It's all hollow and meaningless anyway, so... Did I say it right? I'm... We'd come in on Tuesday, and we'd kind of block it, and we'd work it, but it was our time to present our ideas and our thoughts and, \"Hey, what if it was like this? \"What about that?\" And just kind of stop and just watch? Yeah, cos you supposed to hear the kids and turn back around. OK. That Tuesday and Wednesday would be a beautifully collaborative period where the actors would find the soul and the truth of the moments for these characters. The idea that we, as a black show on TV, one of three at the time, right...? There weren't really us in the writers' room... Right. ..and as an actor, you never had a voice. You never had a voice in the room. You were a puppet who was told what to do. Take your notes. Say this line. Yeah. Move over here. KARYN: At some point, the producers and the writers wanted to make Hilary a strong black woman. They wanted to, like, see that switch in her, and then I felt, like, you know, there are some people who are just flawed and see things a certain way, and you can learn a lot from them too. Look, I'm a career woman. I don't have time to dust and push around that... Oh, what do you call that big loud thing that sucks up everything? We were able to share the experience, the real experience and gave those writers our perspective. Yeah. You can put your hands down, Jazz. No way. Dude's got a gun. Next thing you know, I got six warning shots in my back. When we did the courtroom scene, there was a level of truth to it. That's the reason why they wrote it. SLOWLY: I'm putting my hands down now. Part of the power of what we would always do with the Fresh Prince, there would be very powerful ideas under the jokes and under the comedy. You can wear the T-shirts, you can put up the posters, and you can shout the slogans, but unless you know all the history behind it, you're trivialising the entire struggle. That is one of those things that I think kind of makes people understand just how ground-breaking this show was. It is as relevant today as it was 30 years ago, unfortunately. Whenever we would come across moments that they wrote that was like, \"This wouldn't happen...\" Right. \"Black people don't do this.\" Right. Yes! Yeah. Tuesday and Wednesday is what made... Absolutely. ..this show special, because we made sure that we were authentic... Yeah. ..every episode. I had spent a career being on shows that showed the variety of the black culture, showing that we were not just a monolithic group of people with one idea and one lifestyle. And when I got here, we had the freedom to express to the writers the cultural aspects of what they had in the written word. I remember a table read one Monday, and there was some line that they had given Tatyana to say, and I said, \"Excuse me, if Tatyana says that to her daddy, \"she'd lose her teeth.\" Yeah, yeah, exactly, exactly. No. Culturally, we don't do that. Right. Yeah. Right. James used to sit where you're sitting... Yeah. That was James's spot. ..during those note sessions... Yeah. ..and that is where I learned that what we do is not for us. It's not about us. We are here to bring dignity... Mm-hm. ..to represent, to expand, to push forward, and I learned that here at his feet. This one takes the cake. James is the heart of the show. I love you, Uncle Phil. We knew that he knew the answers or could guide folks to the answers. Carlton, sit. As you wish, Father. James had a very deep love of jazz music, and I would spend a lot of times in his dressing room, and he would give me jazz CDs. You know, he got his Billie Holiday picture up on the wall, a little Charlie \"Bird\" Parker, you know? Boy, I'm telling you, this man got mad flavour! The music that was coming out of his room was always just amazing. Ashley, honey, this is possibly the most beautiful music ever written. He was my teacher. I learned what it means to be an artist from him. Learning that there's other works, there's other arts out there that would help you understand yours even better. I was watching this Robeson documentary, and James used to bring up Paul Robeson. He, like, introduced me to black art in ways that... I wouldn't have got that education anywhere else, and I'm watching this documentary, and they're talking about him singing Ol' Man River... ..him changing the word from \"nigger\" to \"darkie\"... Darkie, yeah. ..how hard he had to fight... Mm-hm. ..for that one word. Yeah. Wow. It wasn't that long ago. And then when you think about... And it wasn't that long ago. So you think about that, you think about all the shows that came before, and I'm just talking about television. Every little step. And now what we see, it's such a privilege to be a part of that. Yes. Yeah. You know, that history, and those notes sessions. That's where I went to school, like, that's... And that was... No, that was the thing. James, he pushed me so hard. You think you're so wise. Look at me when I'm talking to you. Let me tell you something, son. I grew up on the streets just like you. I encountered bigotry you could not imagine. Now, you have a nice poster of Malcolm X on your wall. I heard the brother speak. I read every word he wrote. Believe me, I know where I come from. His thing was that, \"I am in such a unique position, \"and that responsibility, \"you must elevate your craft. \"You have to represent, and you are paving a way,\" and he just wouldn't give me an inch, and I remember in the... One of my favourite and most famous scenes from Fresh Prince is the father episode. Hey, what's up, man? Can I get you something? Erm, no, I'm fine, son. Um... Er, if you need... So is he a cop? He's my father. So, you know, James Avery was this 6'4\", 300-pound... Plus. Yeah... ..stage-trained... Yeah. ..Shakespearean beast, right? And I'm... I'm the little rapper from Philly under him, right? And I wanted him to think I was good so bad. You wanted him to be proud of you. I wanted him to be proud of me. So the episode comes, and, you know, we come to that scene, and I was like, I'm... You know, I want to deliver this scene so bad, and if you remember, in front of the audience, I flubbed my line on the take. Mm-hm. And I messed it up in front of the audience, and my mind snapped, and I was like, \"Argh!\" I'm like, \"Argh! Damn it!\" And James says, \"Hey! Right here!\" And I was like... And he was like, \"Use me!\" And I'm like... And I'm right there, and he takes, and he's like, \"Get yourself together,\" And I get it together, and I'm looking, and he says, \"Action.\" I'm sorry, I... You know, if there was something that I could do... Hey, you know what? You ain't got to do nothing, Uncle Phil. You know, ain't like I'm still five years old, you know? Ain't like I'm-a be sitting up every night asking my mom, \"When's Daddy coming home?\" You know? Who needs him? And the scene that we do is the scene that ended up being in the episode. I ain't need him then, and I don't need him now. Will, Will... Nah, you know what, Uncle Phil? I'm-a get through college without him. I'm-a get a great job without him. I'm-a marry me a beautiful honey, and I'm-a have me a whole bunch of kids. I'm-a be a better father than he ever was! And I sure as hell don't need him for that, cos ain't a damn thing he could ever teach me about how to love my kids! How come he don't want me, man? And I fall into his arms at the end of the scene, and he's holding me and he's holding me, and, you know, the shot pans off, and he whispered in my ear, he said, \"Now, that's acting,\" right? That's right. \"That's acting.\" And I was like, \"Argh! Argh!\" You know, every single time. I cry every time I see that. Every single time, you know? And it's like, he just... He, erm... He, er... It's like... Oh, come on. Don't do this. I know, I'm s... I'm sorry. Tatyana throwing me off. Erm... And it's like, when, er... It's, like, people do... People don't even know when they're shaping you and forming you and crafting you... Yeah, yeah. He knew. ..in that way. He knew. No, that's what I'm saying. I think he knew. He knew what he was doing. There's some people that plant seeds. Yep. That's what they do. And they do it to anyone they come across. I mean, he was... He was proud of who he was. He was proud of his race. He was proud of the history of his race. And, you know, he could see it, you know, and it fell upon you. It fell upon you to grab the reins. Vote for Philip Banks. Philip Banks. Philip Banks. Break out Lucille. THEY LAUGH I've got a few questions for you. When you got this alleged confession from these two young men, did they have a lawyer present? No. So, Officer, just open that damn cell and let those two boys out of there, or I'm going to tie this place up with so much litigation that your grandchildren are going to need lawyers! That's right! SCREAMING Nicky, you remember in The Lion King when Mufasa... Daddy, did you sit on Harry? Yes, but... But... That's OK, Dad. Death is a natural part of life. APPLAUSE All right, all right. Oh, no. Now, noble Geoffrey, the gods today stand beside us. A lot of good times in this house, huh? A lifetime's worth. Trust me, Will. I know it doesn't feel like it right now, but what they say is true. Winning really isn't everything. I'm sorry I let you down, son. You could never let me down, Dad. I love you. Just remember, happiness comes from inside. I love you, Daddy. Nobody does anything without help, Will. People opened doors for me, and I've worked hard to open doors for you. It doesn't make you any less of a man to walk through them. I have something special. You always said that spending time with me and the family was the most important thing to you. I'm lucky to have such a wonderful family. Look, Uncle Phil, I just don't want you to think that I'm that same stupid kid I was when I first moved out here. I love you, Uncle Phil, and I just don't want to lose you, you know, any of you. You're not going to lose us. You are my son, Will. End of story. Well, guys... ..give him a hand. Yeah. Give him a hand. Yes. Oh, James, I miss you. James, man. Whew. I think what happens on family shows like this, it's one of those things, you cannot buy or fake chemistry. It's just the way that we all came together as a group was very special. So as a family, you know, we have our things that we talk about and then we have our things that we don't talk about. Where are you going with this? You know? We, erm, never really together, like, publicly talk about, um, Janet... Mm. ..and what happened. And, er, for me, it felt like... ..I couldn't celebrate 30 years of Fresh Prince without finding a way to celebrate Janet. So she agreed to sit down and have a conversation with me, and Janet and I saw one another for the first time in 27 years... Wow. ..yesterday. And I want to show you guys some of... Oh, my gosh. Oh, wow. Wow. Take a seat here. OK. Thank you very much. If you need anything at all, let me know. OK. OK, thank you. Tell me if my eyes glow like a raccoon... SHE LAUGHS ..cos they sometimes do. Your eyes look spectacular. THEY LAUGH Good to see you. You too. Oh, my God. Where are you sitting? Been a long time. It's been a real long time. 20... 30. 30! THEY LAUGH My name is Janet Hubert, and I played the role of Vivian Banks. I guess they call me the OG, the original Aunt Vivian. The night is young, baby, and so am I. My life is great. This party is going to be great, and I look fantastic. Janet brought such authenticity and dignity. My name is not Mom. My name is Professor Banks. That is how I prefer to be addressed. Is that clear, class? ALL: Yes, Professor Banks. I didn't expect to get the role, because I had not seen anyone who looked like me playing those kinds of roles. We just want to make sure that the person we get is properly qualified. For example, a college professor with a PhD who's taught black history and literature at the university level. Where are we going to find someone like that? You're looking at her. Janet was this beautiful, dark-skinned, talented... She could sing, she could dance. I enjoyed it. I loved it. I loved the way they wrote. I loved that she was professional. I loved that she was intelligent, she was refined, but I also loved that she could throw down. This has got to be the biggest amateur operation I have seen since Mayberry RFD! It was a rare thing to be able to say, wearing a $5,000 sweater, \"What? What? Philip?\" Oh, honey, we're about to get very busy up in here. \"Hold me back. Hold me back.\" There was a certain foundational element that was broken when Janet left. Well... ..this has been tough. Yeah. Has it been tough for you? Oh, yes, it has. Yeah. I just wanted to know one thing. Mm-hm. Why? Why so far? You guys went so far. I lost so much. I think what would be... How do we heal that? ..helpful for me is, like... ..I... You look good, by the way. Oh, thank you. Thank you. You look beautiful, as always. Older, wiser. So I think it would be helpful for me... Like, I don't know your story. Mm-hm. I know. I know. You know? I know. I don't know... You have no idea. You know, I don't know your story. It was insane. Something I would like to clarify is during that third season when I got pregnant, there was a lot of things going on in my life and in Will's life as well. There was some friction because I was pregnant. Home life was not good at all. I was no longer laughing, smiling, joking because there were things that were going on that nobody knew about. The cast had no idea what was going on. You know, during that time of her pregnancy, I wasn't sensitive, I wasn't perceptive, and, you know, now that I've had three kids, I've learned some things that I did not know at the time, and I would do things very differently, but I can see where I made the set very difficult for Janet. They offered me this really bad deal in the third season. They said, \"You've got two months and two weeks of work, \"and you cannot work anywhere else.\" So that meant my salary was cut. I had a new baby and a husband who was out of work, so I said no. I did not accept their offer. I was never fired. So the misconception was always put out there. I was trapped. What could I do? So they said, \"OK, then we're going to recast your role.\" And I said, \"What can I say?\" I was hurt deeply, deeply. So talk me through, because I was having a different experience. You were going forward and getting bigger, but we knew you were going to be huge. I mean, we all knew that. I even said that, that part of the success of the show was because of your success, but you were destined for that as well. But when I left the show, I had this new baby and no-one. Family disowned me. Hollywood disowned me. My family said, \"You've ruined our name.\" And I wasn't unprofessional on the set. I just stopped talking to everybody because I didn't know who to trust because I had been banished. And they said it was you who... ..who banished me. Because you were... ..you were Will. You were a kid. It was hard. Yeah. I was, er, 21 years old. Yeah. You know? I know. Erm... I know. Everything was a threat to me. Why was I a threat? Not you. The world. I was so driven by fear, and jokes and comedy and all of that... Yeah, you were. ..was how... You were live. Yeah. You were live. You know? But what you didn't realise either, that I was going through a lot at home. Mm-hm, right. You didn't know. Yup, yup. You guys didn't know. Very abusive marriage. You know, I have children. Yeah. I've been divorced and I've had a second marriage, and I can see now the level of pain and the level of struggle that it was for you just to show up every day, and then... But you took all that away from me... Mm-hm. ..with your words. You know, words can kill. Mm-hm. I lost everything. Reputation, everything, everything. And I understand you were able to move forward, but you know those words - calling a black woman difficult in Hollywood is the kiss of death. Mm-hm. It's the kiss of death, and it's hard enough being a dark-skinned black woman in this business. But I felt it was necessary for us to finally move forward. Yep. And I'm sorry that I have blasted you to pieces. Nah, it's... It is, erm, so... First of all, thank you for sharing that with me. Like, I didn't... ..know that. When I've looked back now, it's, you know, it's obvious that you were having a hard time, and... I felt like you hated me. No. You know, I... I could not do a 30-year celebration of this show and not celebrate you, celebrate your contribution to the show, celebrate your contribution to my life, you know? And... Come here, you. 27 years... I think... I think we were just short of 27 years that we didn't speak to one another, and I'm just... I'm glad we're talking again. The person I want to be is someone who protects you, not someone that unleashes dogs on you. And... However... I appreciate that. You know, it's... I appreciate that. I have to say, after 27 years, being here today and having the conversation that Will and I had together, it's healing. I was watching the dance episode the other day, and that's become one of the crazy, iconic... Yeah. They send me videos from all over the world... On TikTok right now. ..of their mamas doing it. I know, right? Their mamas... Listen. The Aunt Viv, boy, rocking the Aunt Viv. The Aunt Viv! WILL LAUGHS I don't know if it's real. I feel like this is a dream. I didn't come here to have animosity. I came here to resolve, cos it's time. You still feel like...? Like I'm little? Yeah. You're still my Aunt Viv. You're still my Aunt Viv. Yeah, you do. It's so weird. You know, we've said such hateful things about each other publicly. I know. Ugh. And I'm sorry. I'm sorry. And I'm sorry too. We good? Hey, we good. We good. We are good. One of the major things for me, it was the first time I was ever able to see how much pain she is in and was in and just... Jesus. ..what she was carrying, you know, and what she was trying to hide, what she was trying to hold on to, and, you know, she set a tone, and she set a standard on this show that's an integral part of the success of the Fresh Prince, you know? So she asked to... ..you know, were you guys open to speak to her, and, you know, is... I've never met her. You've never met her? I have never met her. Wow. Janet Hubert-Whitten, ladies and gentlemen. CHEERING AND APPLAUSE What's up?! KARYN: Seeing Daphne and Janet, my two moms, the two Aunt Vivs come together, and they've never met before... Seeing them meet for the first time and embrace was the most incredible thing. That was chilling. That was a dream come true. That was a full-circle moment. It just... It made my heart really full. I cannot tell you how unbelievable and wonderful it feels that I... I'm overwhelmed. I don't want to be that guy, you know? I go out in the world and I, you know, talk about understanding and human relationships, and then have somebody that I haven't spoken to in 27 years. I just... I'm so happy that we were able to make that reconciliation, and I hope other people can take something from it. What was so great about this show was how we became a family. You kind of fall into your roles and, erm... THEY CHEER Oh! Oh! That's so awesome! Yes! Hello. Nicky, Nicky, Nicky. Oh, my gosh. Hey, my man. How are you, buddy? My baby grew up. Great to see you. Good to see you too. What's up, man? What's up? What's up? Man, it's so good to see everybody. This is so surreal. I mean, the recreation of the set is incredible. I mean, I feel like a kid again. Yeah! When you look back on these kinds of experiences, it's never going to be about money, it's never going to be about success, it's going to be about the people that you shared a chunk of your life with. Come on, let's go on inside. Let's check and see what's going on on the set, you know, backstage and all that. The Friday night ritual? Erm... What was it like? We'd go to Will's room. He would be jamming in there! MUSIC: Apache by The Sugarhill Gang You'd just start hearing music coming from Will's room, booming, and you'd just start following, like the Pied Piper. # Tonto, jump on it, jump on it, jump on it... # We would have music playing, we would dance, jam, have a great time, singing, rapping, whatever. It was just kind of like, \"Oh, my God, this is a Friday night party!\" # Apache, jump on it, jump on it... # It was kind of like I think what you would do before a concert or something. You know, the whole band gets together and says a prayer. I just have to say there's not another group of people that I would rather be in this kind of circle with 149-some-odd times.... CHEERING Yeah! Ditto! Ditto? Even though James takes up most of the circle... LAUGHTER Ditto! As well I should! Let's go out there and let's just have some fun... CHEERING We changed the way sitcoms were shot. People would come to the taping like they were going to a club. And it was a full-on experience. How are y'all doing? SCREAMING We'd have our moment together, and then we'd head out. And we would get to our living room and there was a little dairy basket of musical percussion instruments... That's a good one, that's a good one. Hold on. All right, I think I'm going to do that, I'm going to do that. But this is how we would do. This is how we'd do. CHEERING We'd each grab one and we would start. Sometimes it was just sticks, it was all kinds of stuff to bang on the walls and create rhythms. The energy that that created for a live performance is not to be believed. Yeah, yeah, all right, we're about to go on stage. We're live, the audience is out there. We would just get the energy up to here and then, like, surge. Miss Tatyana M Ali! AUDIENCE CHEERS We felt like it was a show. It wasn't a TV show. It was a show. Alfonso Ribeiro! Miss Karyn Parsons! Hilary! Miss Daphne Maxwell Reid! Vivian! AUDIENCE CHEERS James Avery! Uncle Phil! I wanted to hit the stage like a fighter, you know, with your theme music coming and all of that. Mr Will! Will Smith! AUDIENCE CHEERS Will kind of brought the energy that we had in doing music to the show - crowd participation, throw your hands in the air. Let me hear you say \"Yeah!\" CROWD: Yeah! \"Hell, yeah!\" Hell, yeah! Everybody, scream! AUDIENCE SCREAMS Everyone felt like they wanted to be at a Fresh Prince taping on a Friday night. It was the hottest ticket in town, as they called it. Everybody, scream! AUDIENCE SCREAMS There was nothing like that. LAUGHTER Get off me! SHE CHOKES SHE SIGHS We knew at the end of season five that there would only be one more season. Welcome to the... Welcome to the final reading of The Fresh Prince Of Bel-Air. All right, gang. Here we go. Let's give it a read! We fade in, for the last time... LAUGHTER It was hard to come to terms with. You know, it was six years of playing house with people I adored. We really did become family. And it's something that is the essence of the show. It's so strange because, now, like James was saying and what Tatyana was saying, everybody, we're such a family now. And it's just so sad. It's so sad! This is so hard! You know, I was an only child, so here, all of the sudden, I have a brother and a sister and I had Will, who was like a brother, and James Avery took being my father very seriously. He called me \"daughter\". Alfonso was absolutely a big brother to me. Karyn is just a woman that I look up to and admire. A lot of good times spent in this house. A lifetime's worth. I'm not gonna miss the house, though. I'm-a miss all the people that lived in the house. You know, but I want you to call me on Sundays when you call the rest... Well, I want you to call me on Sundays when you call the rest of your children. I love you, Uncle Phil, and I don't want to lose you. I mean, any of you. They embrace. Think about, like, people that you see every single day for six years of your life. You see them more than you see your own family! OK, and wrap. APPLAUSE This has been very unique for all of us. And I can honestly say - because I've been working, like, about 15 years or so, I don't know - but this has been the best experience in terms of a TV show, in terms of people and friends and happiness. And I've got to stop now... LAUGHTER OK. LAUGHTER You know, it was a very difficult week for all of us, knowing that we were never going to be together again like that ever again. You know, we've been blessed in a way that... ..a lot of people don't get to experience and to be able to do what we love, but to also put things out in the world that display our love. And I've done a lot of things in my life, and I just want to thank all of you for making this the most beautiful job and life experience that I've ever had. Y'all know that this the final episode of Fresh Prince Of Bel-Air, right? You know, it's sad, but we had a six-year run, so we would like for y'all to sit back and enjoy the second half of what you just watched. Ladies and gentlemen, The Fresh Prince Of Bel-Air, for the last time, coming at you. Peace! APPLAUSE The final week was interesting. For me, it was... It's still... It was fuzzy in my mind. I think that's part of my emotional defence. I always live in the future. My mind is always in the next space. And I think as a child, that's how I learned to avoid the pain of a present moment. Counting, three, two... Oh, God! LAUGHTER Good start, good start, good start! I see pictures from that week and everything. And it's like... It was such a deeply... ..um... ..painful goodbye. Being pulled away from these people was really difficult. I loved being with them. And we'd also gone through something so life-changing for all of us, so we were bonded in this way. I wasn't in the last scene. I was in one of the early scenes. And right after I did my scene, I took a deep breath and I waited for the director to say \"clear\" and \"moving on\". And when he said \"moving on\", I slowly walked off the set, went in the dressing room, grabbed my bag, got in the car and drove to the airport and flew home. I couldn't... I couldn't do it. All of my... I mean, 11 to 17, it's such a huge... You know, you grow so much during that time. I did it all with them. And when I saw that stage empty, it was just like... I could barely breathe. It didn't come to a head until the last scene shooting. And we knew that this was the last time we were going to hug these people on this set. Leaving is like leaving a grand old friend. Having to walk off the set, that was hard. You know, it was like I was out of my body, watching myself walk all the way out and not stopping, and then I was out of frame... ..and I was done. I remember that when it was all said and done, I couldn't stop crying. You OK? Yeah, yeah, no, I'm cool. I'm cool, Uncle Phil. You know, it's just when I first came out here, you know... ..I was a relative. Been here for the past six years - like, we've been family. I just don't want to go back to being just a relative again. I mean, I lived without a father and without brothers and sisters and all of that. I like this life better. CARLTON: Hey, who turned out the lights?! LAUGHTER Where is everybody?! I am definitely going to miss you, C. LAUGHTER APPLAUSE We've been a part of creating something that has touched millions and millions of hearts around the world. And on this set I learned how to lead my life. You know, I figured out who I wanted to be on this set with all of you making this show, so... ..this was family. This IS family. This IS family. I love you guys so much. You have no idea. I think... No, you do. THEY LAUGH I think the continuing legacy for Fresh Prince will simply be that we changed television in a positive way and that we will go down in history as one of the best to have ever done it. I mean, it's become legendary. It has become really, really special. We were so fortunate. It was like no experience ever, but I had it. We had no idea that it was going to be the iconic show that it became. While we were filming this, you know, Will tweeted out a picture. And I saw a lot of posts about the picture and a lot of people responded. And people said \"#BlackExcellence\", right? And it made me think about what our show meant to people and why it's lasted so long. And I don't want to be mistaken that the excellence part is the wealth. That part is the fantasy. The excellence was the way that we loved each other. You know, the thing that's difficult is that, you know, we're a family, you know? Of course, it's a TV show, and, you know, we're only playing a family, but you really develop family-like relationships. You know, it was such a beautiful way to have these memories and to be able to say goodbye to this show and to this section of our lives with dignity. I think we all... You know, to an extent, we've all gone off and lived our lives, but there will always be a piece of all of us in that living room. And it was nice for all of us to share it for one more day. Y'all ready? Let's go! Let's go! CHEERING MUSIC: Fresh Prince Of Bel-Air Theme # Now this is a story all about how # My life got flipped, turned upside down # So I'd like to take a minute Just sit right there # I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel-Air... # One thing that always bugged me about the show? Nothing bugged me about the show. Well, I guess the one thing that bugged me is that... MUSIC: It's Not Unusual by Tom Jones Uh-oh! Oh! We doing it? Where we doing it? What you got? What you got? I never could do this. I never could do this. You got to start right here. # It's not unusual to be loved by anyone... # Oh, oh, oh, oh! # It's not unusual to have fun with anyone... # Now do the steps! # But when I see you hanging about with anyone # It's not unusual to see me cry # I wanna die... # There it is right there, y'all. Bring it in right there. Yes, on three. One, two, three, yes! Are we done? That's it. That's it? That's it. See you in ten years. LAUGHTER "}
